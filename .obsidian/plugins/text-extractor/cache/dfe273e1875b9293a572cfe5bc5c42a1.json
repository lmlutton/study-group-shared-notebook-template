He also had some difficulty thinking of questions to ask another person, and often related his responses throughout the task back to his areas of interest. In addition, B eckett had difficulty sequencing pictures to tell a story, narrating the story accurately, and providing a title for the story. His challenges with interpreting facial expressions and making inferences impacted his ability to accurately describe what was happening in the pictures. Throughout the evaluation, there were significant delays in B eckett’s responses to questions, particularly those that seemed to be more challenging for him.

He entered the classroom on time, set his things down at his seat, and briefly left the room to fill up his water bottle. When he returned, he paused to look at something on the teacher’s desk, then walked over to the windows by his seat. He slowly wandered by the windows for several minutes until all the students had arrived and class was starting, then he sat down. The teacher, Ms. Fiore, presented instructions for a summative assessment on the smartboard at the front of the room and began explaining the directions. B eckett initially appeared to be staring across the room rather than looking at the board. A fter a delay, he looked at the Diagnostic Summary Report P age ____ of _____ D IA GNOSTIC SUMMA RY REPORT Student: Other Individual Evaluation Results (Use additional pages if necessary) D ate: 2/11/25 board. B eckett alternated between looking off into space and looking at the board. When Ms. Fiore asked if there were any questions, he verbally responded “mm-mm” (no). He pulled out his laptop and opened it along with the rest of the class to begin working on the assignment. Ms. Fiore walked over to B eckett and asked if he had any questions. He began to say “N-” then after a delay, said, “No, none.” He began working on something on his laptop. A fter a few minutes, Ms. Fiore checked in on B eckett and helped him to find the assignment on google classroom. He answered her questions about what he was planning to do, and politely said, “Okay then” in response to her directions. B eckett appeared to be working on his laptop, and very slowly took out headphones and put them on. Ms. Fiore checked in on him again and pointed out where he could find several resources for the assignment. He took out some highlighters and appeared to become distracted by them, looking at them for approximately 15 seconds. He slowly re-adjusted his headphones again before returning his attention to his computer screen. B eckett appeared to need more instructions and redirection from the teacher than his peers in order to complete the assignment. His inattention and tendency to stare off into space or at an object at times was also noticeably different compared to the behavior of his peers. TYPE OF TEST/EVA LUATION: Teacher input/social emotional NA ME(S) OF TEST(S) GIVEN: D ynamic A ssessment of Social Emotional Learning EXA MINER & QUA LIFIC ATIONS: C atherine Wells, MS, C C C -SLP D ATE(S) OF THIS EVA LUATION: 2/11/25 The teacher form from the Dynamic Assessment of Social Emotional Learning (DASEL) was completed by B eckett’s case manager in order to gather information regarding his social and emotional abilities.This questionnaire was used to gain insight into B eckett’s emotional regulation, friendships, and problem-solving skills in the school setting. Per teacher report, B eckett has been observed to connect with other students, advocate for himself, and get frustrated easily. He has not been observed to consistently ask for help when needed, participate with the rest of the class, work well in groups, or self-regulate and control his emotions. B eckett shows strengths such as following one-step directions. In addition, when engaged in a high-interest subject, he can focus for long periods of time. He appears to have a desire to make connections with other students. Some of B eckett’s biggest challenges are organizing his time effectively and focusing when he is tired. He also does not remember names and faces, so he will often ask Diagnostic Summary Report P age ____ of _____ D IA GNOSTIC SUMMA RY REPORT Student: Other Individual Evaluation Results (Use additional pages if necessary) D ate: peers who should be familiar to him what their names are. B eckett attempts to engage with other students and will reintroduce himself to them frequently, especially during advisory. Unfortunately, many of these peers do not have much in common with B eckett, so it is difficult for him to develop a friendship with them. B eckett benefits from accommodations such as having one-to-one assistance with coming up with a task list for completion, frequent check-ins for comprehension and to ensure that he is on task, and using an alarm system to ensure he gets from place to place on time. A morning check-in to support this is helpful. Diagnostic Summary Report P age ____ of _____","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
