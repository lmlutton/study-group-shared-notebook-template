He is a passionate and friendly young man. He continues to be a part of the Mahjong Club and has been participating in the Outing Club opportunities. Beckett is a Japanophile and enjoys all aspects of Japanese language and culture. He likes to share his love of all things Japan with adults and peers. He also has shown interest in Chinese and French culture. Beckett also has many other hobbies including watchmaking and music. Beckett is a kind and respectful student. While Beckett is almost always respectful, sometimes to a fault, he has continued to be a more vocal advocate for himself and what he enjoys– and does not enjoy– in his learning and social activities at school. In most recent testing (May 2022) Beckett showed “very high” abilities in Mathematics, especially in the areas of problem solving and numerical operations. On his Speech and Language assessment, Beckett showed strengths in formulated sentences– the ability to create complete, grammatically correct sentences; word deﬁnitions– the ability to understand and orally give detailed deﬁnitions of words; sentence assembly– the ability to put scrambled sentences into a grammatically correct sentence; and semantic relationships–the ability to interpret relationships between words. In the domain of social pragmatics, Beckett’s areas of strength included understanding and demonstrating personal space, physical appearance, and emotional regulation. Beckett has learned a number of pragmatic skills so that he is able to look like a typical student in a classroom setting at times, in terms of posture, looking in the direction of the teacher, using polite language with adults and students, and appropriately greeting teachers and peers. Describe the Student’s: Academic Needs: Beckett is identiﬁed as a student with autism. As a result of his autism Beckett struggles with receptive language and conversation skills, executive function skills (such as maintaining attention, focus and organization), reading comprehension and essay writing. Beckett’s ability to pay attention to verbal/oral information is diminished and signiﬁcantly interferes with his recall and comprehension of information presented in a classroom setting, as well as in typical conversations with peers or adults in less structured settings. Beckett needs to sit in an area of the classroom with the least amount of distractions in order to assist his ability to focus. Beckett needs repetition and visual support when he is presented with oral/auditory information. Beckett struggles with attending to conversations, even in small group settings. Beckett is not always aware of his own gestures, non-verbal behaviors and how he is perceived by others. Beckett also demonstrates challenges engaging in reciprocal conversation, turn-taking with peers in small and large group settings. In one-to-one, small group, and large group settings, Beckett requires consistent cueing in order to attend, participate in, and remember conversations. Beckett continues to need help starting conversations, but responds well to direct questions that require short answers. Beckett will need to process through his responses, so wait time for an answer is important. Open-ended questions can be difﬁcult for Beckett. It can be difﬁcult for him to recall information needed to answer a question, and may need prompts to remember or help with word retrieval. Reading comprehension continues to be an area of weakness for Beckett (WIAT-4 2022- Reading Comprehension: SS-84, 14th percentile (Below Average). Inferencing is a challenge for Beckett and his struggles with theory of mind make it difﬁcult for him to make assumptions about characters thoughts–unless they are explicit. Beckett requires access to comprehension questions during reading and cues to recall what information he should be looking for. Beckett also needs cueing and guiding to help him with inferential questions about what he reads.

He often struggles with expanding his writing. Given a clear expectation for the amount that needs to be written (i.e. write at least 4 sentences) Beckett will often expand his writing to meet the requirement. Without the explicit direction, however, he will often only write a sentence or two. Beckett requires the support of a shared paraprofessional for academic classes for the purpose of cues to remain on task, organization, and attention to task including initiation and completion of tasks according to expectations. He also beneﬁts from support with communication when self-advocating. One-on-one support is beneﬁcial for ﬁeld trips due to his challenges with face blindness, and place blindness as he can get lost in a new environment. Developmental Needs: Beckett has been diagnosed by a medical professional with autism (Dr. Margaret Bauman). As a result Beckett may ﬁnd it hard to pay attention to others, communicate effectively, understand others perspectives, initiate tasks, and self- regulate. In addition to these, his episodic memory and demand recall are characteristically intermittent. These challenges affect Beckett’s learning and development. Beckett has topographic agnosia– or “place blindness.” He will easily get lost– especially in new settings or if his routine is broken. In addition, Beckett is affected by prosopagnosia– the inability to recognize faces with consistency– unless it is a person Beckett interacts with on a daily basis. This impacts Becketts ability to build relationships with others as he frequently has to ask familiar peers and adults their name. Beckett requires the support of a shared paraprofessional for academic classes for the purpose of cues to remain on task, organization, and attention to task including initiation and completion of tasks according to expectations. He also beneﬁts from support with communication when self-advocating. One-on-one support is beneﬁcial for ﬁeld trips due to his challenges with face blindness, and place blindness as he can get lost in a new environment. Functional Needs: Beckett needs supports in the area of executive functioning to help organize his work, and remembering to complete assignments for what needs to be done. A paraeducator also works with Beckett on planning out his day with what to work on for classes and what needs to be turned in for the day. Beckett has been using the Google Calendar to set reminders for himself, the school team and his family to support him. In addition to his Google Calendar, he has a school planner. He still requires heavy amounts of adult prompting to use his school planner. He prefers to use the Google Calendar but does not always remember even with his reminders. Beckett occasionally gets overwhelmed–especially if other students are engaging in “unexpected” behavior. Beckett gets very uncom- fortable if he sees or hears students breaking school rules. He has been more in control of these situations this school year. Beckett struggles with attending to conversations, even in small group settings. Beckett is not always aware of his own gestures, non-verbal behaviors and how he is perceived by others. Beckett also demonstrates challenges engaging in reciprocal conversation, turn-taking with peers in small and large group settings. In one-to-one, small and large group settings, Beckett requires consistent cuing in order to attend to conversations, participate in, and remember conversations.

He also beneﬁts from support with communication when self-advocating. One-on-one support is beneﬁcial for ﬁeld trips due to his challenges with face blindness, and place blindness as he can get lost in a new environment. Describe the Parent Concerns for Improving the Student’s Education: Beckett is an adult student. He shares his primary concern is with making friendship and being sure he does not get overwhelmed with school work. Date Created: 08/27/2024 IEP Page 3 of 25 Student Name: Beckett Pettit Lutton LEA DOB: 10/20/2005, SASID: 1336514843 SAU 31 Newmarket Historical information shared by parents: Beckett’s parents continue to be concerned about his inclusion and connections within the Newmarket community. They would like him to be a full participant in the school and neighborhood community and to have friendships with his peers and community members. Beckett’s parents want to see him be as independent as possible while still maintaining a level of success with his academics. Parent’s goal is to eliminate paraprofessional support by Beckett’s “senior” year (2023-2024). Beckett’s parents want him to ﬁnd effective organizational tools and skills that will serve him post-high school. Beckett would like to go on to the next level of college mathematics (beyond AP Calculus and Statistics) and parents would like to see this happen. Parents would like to ensure the team is making pragmatic choices about what he will do after high school and then do the best that we can to prepare him. He needs to choose a career in which he can succeed, which is difﬁcult for most people to predict. Fathers primary concern is with his ability to focus on tasks.

While both raters felt Beckett’s abilities in this area overall fell within the Moderately Low range, the related subdomains had varying results. The Daily Living Skills measure Beckett’s ability to complete everyday tasks of living. His functioning in this domain was generally adequate, but he received a lower rating in his ability to function independently within the community. The Socialization Domain assesses Beckett’s functioning in social situations. This was Beckett’s weakest domain, although there was some discrepancy between home and school in the subdomains of Play/Leisure and Coping Skills. Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning, Second Edition (BRIEF-2) Ms. Metzler completed the Teacher Report, Mr. Lutton completed the Parent Report, and Beckett completed the Self Report with the help of this examiner. Beckett has several areas of signiﬁcant difﬁculty with executive functioning. All three raters ﬁnd Beckett’s executive functioning as Clinically Elevated in the areas of Working Memory. Ms. Metzler and Mr. Lutton agree that keeping materials organized and planning ahead are areas of signiﬁcant weakness for Beckett. Interestingly, while they feel that Beckett has typical emotional control for his age, Beckett rated his emotional control as Clinically Elevated. He also noted having struggles in his ability to shift from one task to another, monitor his own behavior, and complete tasks independently. Beckett will be due for his next evaluation in May of 2025. He will be tested in the following areas: academic performance, adaptive behavior, communicative skills, health as well as hearing and vision screening. Describe how the student’s disability affects the student’s involvement and progress in the general curriculum: Beckett has difﬁculty with executive functioning skills due to his disability. He currently requires adult support to follow his schedule, organize his materials, and meet age and grade appropriate social expectations. Beckett may have difﬁculty understanding non-verbal language and inferring what is expected by observing others. When asked a question and/or given a direction, Beckett requires increased processing time to formulate his response. Describe how the student’s disability affects non-academic areas: Beckett’s disability affects non-academic areas such as PE, clubs and less structured times like assemblies and advisory. Beckett struggles with making deeper relationships with peers but enjoys making connections with others. Beckett continues to need adult assistance to help him understand social situations between his peers and when it is and isn’t appropriate to comment on other’s behavior. Beckett has tried to wander off from the group on school ﬁeld trips. Last school year, Beckett tried to leave the group during the trip to the Civic Center to talk to a person who appeared to be of Japanese origin. Beckett shares that he wouild like to make friends but struggles to understand how to make and keep a true friendship. He reports knowing the friendship pyramid but cannot generalize applying this knowledge to a social scenario.

If the team determines in their consideration of special factors that the student needs a particular device, service, accommodation or modiﬁcation in order for the child to receive a FAPE the Department anticipates the IEP will reﬂect that determination. In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others, has the team considered the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior? Child’s behavior does not impede his/her learning or the learning of others In the case of a child with limited English proﬁciency, did the team consider the language needs of the child as those needs relate to the child’s IEP? Child does not have limited English proﬁciency In the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, did the IEP team determine, after an evaluation of the child’s reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media (including an evaluation of the child’s future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille), that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is appropriate for the child? Child is not blind or visually impaired Does the student have communication needs? Yes If yes, and this child is deaf or hard of hearing, the team considered the child’s language and communica- tion needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child’s language and communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the child’s language and communication mode. Child is not deaf or hard of hearing Does the child need assistive technology devices and services? Child does not need assistive technology Does the student have medical, sensory or physical impairments? Yes If yes, (a) what are they or cite relevant descriptions on previous pages? Beckett has sensory processing needs (including topographic agnosia and prosopagnosia) which may require classroom accommodations. Beckett has learned appropriate strategies for him to get the sensory output that he needs. His preferred choice is to go for a brief walk. Beckett has also been diagnosed with autism by Dr. Margaret Bauman, and this is his primary educational disability. (b) what is needed or being done or may cite to relevant sections of the IEP? IEP goals, objectives, benchmarks and accommodations; paraprofessional support for safety; and self- monitoring of sensory breaks.

Yes Did the student attend the IEP meeting? Yes Student’s Post-Secondary Goals Present Levels of Performance (Based on student’s preferences, needs and interests) 1. Post-Secondary Education/Training Goal: (e.g. 2 or 4 year college, vocational education, continuing and adult education, training program, or on-the job training) Current Academic and Functional Levels in Prepara- tion for Post-Secondary Education/Training: After graduation from high school, Beckett will attend a 4-year college to pursue a degree in Linguistics or the study of foreign languages. Beckett is on track to graduate with a regular high school diploma. In July of 2024, Beckett requested a progress meeting to dis- cuss changing his transition plan from attending to the work force to instead attending a 4-year college to study Linguistics. In addition to the study of linguistics and foreign languages, Beckett has also expressed an interest in studying coding and cryptography. Beckett has also been recently working with an employment consultant he was connected to through New Hampshire Vo- cational Rehabilitation. Through this experience with a job coach, Beckett has gained some employment experience work- ing a limited number of hours at the manufacturing company INGU. A report from the job coach will be completed that summarizes Beckett’s overall performance and will be pro- duced at the end of the job experience. Beckett is currently enrolled in social entrepreneurship which will help him learn the necessary business skills to continue his education in watchmaking. He is also enrolled in Study Skills where he is learning the executive functioning skills nec- essary to continue his studies in watchmaking. Next year 24- 25, Beckett will again take Study Skills to help him learn the necessary executive functioning skills and strategies needed to become an engineer. In the 2024-2025 school year, Beckett is currently enrolled in courses that will support him in increasing his independence with academic skills and functional life skills to meet his post- secondary goal. 2. Post-Secondary Employment Goal: Current Job Skills in Preparation for Post-Secondary Employment: Upon high school graduation, after pursing a college degree in Linguistics, Beckett will work in a ﬁeld related to linguistics and/or foreign languages. Beckett is on track to graduate with a regular high school diploma. Date Created: 08/27/2024 IEP Page 7 of 25 Student Name: Beckett Pettit Lutton LEA DOB: 10/20/2005, SASID: 1336514843 SAU 31 Newmarket Beckett’s current job skills are being assessed by an employ- ment consultant through New Hampshire Vocational Rehabil- itation through a job shadowing experience. Informal reports suggest that he is currently unable to work independently and is making progress towards being able to do so. In the 2024-2025 school year, Beckett is currently enrolled in courses that will support him in increasing his independence with academic skills and functional life skills to meet his post- secondary goal. 3. Post-Secondary Independent Living Goal. If Needed: Current Home/Independent Living Skills in Prepara- tion for Post-Secondary Independent Living: After graduation from high school, when ﬁnancially able, Beckett will live in a dorm or other communal living situation with peers his own age. Beckett currently lives at home with his Mom and step-Dad and will visit his father every other weekend and on holidays. He reports he occasionally helps around the house with chores like taking out the trash. Beckett completed the student transi- tion questionnaire with his case manager on January 30th 2024. and reported he would like to live in a college dorm or other type of communal living situation after high school graduation. When asked if the watchmaking program doesn’t have dorms where he would live, he reported his parents home. When re- minded that his parent will likely not live near the watchmak- ing programs because they are located in New York City, Penn- sylvania, Geneva, etc. Yamato shared that he would like to live in a hotel if he could afford it. When asked if he would like to live in an apartment/ if he felt ready for it, he said yes but he would need help with issues like knowing how often to change his bedsheets. He currently changes his sheets at Dad’s house every time he visits. Beckett’s deﬁcits in social pragmatics and communication could make living in a communal living situation difﬁcult for him, at times. Beckett attended a college program at Cham- plain college last summer. The program reported, “Beckett was a pleasure to be with in general, but that he did need enormous amounts of support both in and outside of the classroom. He needed lots of supervision, guidance and assistance throughout the program.” Beckett participates in general education classes and clubs where he regularly interacts with peers. He currently partici- pates in a structured speech social group at least twice a week where he works on appropriate communication with other peers his age. 4. Future Community Participation: Current Community Participation in Preparation for Post-Secondary Independent Living: After graduation from high school, Beckett will participate in community activities (such as volunteer opportunities with his church). Beckett is an active participant in a bowling league, an accessi- ble basketball program, NH Special Olympics, and historically (when offered) a school Mahjong Club. Beckett has also ex- pressed interest in volunteering to be a translator.

Beckett is currently involved with Vocational Rehabilitation who is helping link him to additional agencies that will help with Beckett’s participation in the community. Beckett com- pleted driver’s education. He has also passed the written driver’s test, but has failed the road test. Beckett can continue to practice driving skills and explore different modes of trans- portation to be able to access his community. 5. Adult Services: Current Adult and Adult Type Services in Preparation for Post-Secondary Independent Living: After graduation from high school, Beckett will work with an area agency to Beckett has been referred to New Hampshire Vocational Re- habilitation and is currently receiving services. Beckett is also currently receiving services from One Sky Community Services. develop a plan for appropriate post-secondary supports and continue to work on vocational skills and independent living skills.

For example, when he started his library job Beckett required at least 3 verbal prompts per step of his checklist (over 35 in total) in order to complete the task. On the WIAT-4 (May 2022) Beckett achieved a standard score of 84, which is in the 14th percentile, on the reading comprehen- sion subtest. This is considered below average for a student his age. Present Functional Performance: Beckett struggles with the ability to attend to a task. This in turn affects his ability to comprehend multi-step checklists and directions without verbal prompting. Beckett struggles with reading comprehension. Annual Measurable Goal: Projected Beginning Date: 03/06/2024 1. By March of 2025, given direct instruction in self-advocacy and self-help skills and given a functional task to complete, Beck- ett will be able to independently follow a multi-step visual checklist to complete the task with no more than 2 verbal prompts with 90% accuracy in 4 out of 5 given opportunities as measured quarterly by data collection, teacher and paraprofessional anec- dotal notes and records.

Date Created: 08/27/2024 IEP Page 11 of 25 Student Name: Beckett Pettit Lutton LEA DOB: 10/20/2005, SASID: 1336514843 SAU 31 Newmarket Present Level of Academic Achievement: The Nonverbal Language Kit Observation Checklists were used in May 2022 to gather information about Beckett’s communication skills. The results revealed differences in Beckett’s understanding, interpre- tation, and use of verbal and nonverbal communication signals. He had difﬁculty understanding nonverbal signals and cues used by others, and also with understanding how his own nonverbal communication signals would be perceived by others. This con- tributes to Beckett’s difﬁculty solving problems that arise during the school day. He relies heavily on adult support to navigate challenges throughout his day. The difﬁculties Beckett displays with these skills impact his ability to communicate effectively with his teachers and peers. Present Functional Performance: In the classroom, Beckett is respectful, participates well, and shows an interest in inter- acting with his peers, such as when they are playing games. However, he can miss social cues during conversations. Beckett has difﬁculty making inferences about what others are thinking or feeling, and why. When watching videos or given a hypothetical scenario, he often focuses on the details and has difﬁculty understanding what is happening as a whole, or making inferences about why things are happening. Beckett beneﬁts from adult prompts to understand what is going on, and what emotions are being depicted. Beckett can require signiﬁcant prompting to correctly solve a novel real-world problem encountered in the class- room or a hypothetical situation with the speech pathologist. He does not often rely on prior knowledge without prompting. He is not able to accurately refer to this information to create context. He often treats scenarios as if they are new and novel each time. Annual Measurable Goal: Projected Beginning Date: 03/06/2024 2. By March of 2025, given direct instruction in Speech and Language and no more than 3 adult prompts, Beckett will develop his inferencing skills in novel problem-solving situations by using context clues and prior knowledge to make informed decisions and generate appropriate solutions in 75% of problem-solving tasks across 3 activities as measured quarterly by speech patholo- gist records and anecdotal notes. Benchmarks/Short-Term Objectives or Progress toward meeting the annual goal Beginning Date By June 2024, given direct instruction in Speech and Language and no more than 8 adult prompts, Beckett will develop his inferencing skills in novel problem-solving situations by using context clues and prior knowledge to make informed decisions and generate appropriate solutions in 60% of problem-solving tasks across 3 activities as measured quarterly by speech pathologist records and anec- dotal notes. 03/06/2024 By November 2024, given direct instruction in Speech and Language and no more than 5 adult prompts, Beckett will develop his inferencing skills in novel problem-solving situations by using con- text clues and prior knowledge to make informed decisions and generate appropriate solutions in 65% of problem-solving tasks across 3 activities as measured quarterly by speech pathologist records and anecdotal notes. 08/27/2024 By January 2025, given direct instruction in Speech and Language and no more than 4 adult prompts, Beckett will develop his inferencing skills in novel problem-solving situations by using context clues and prior knowledge to make informed decisions and generate appropriate solutions in 70% of problem-solving tasks across 3 activities as measured quarterly by speech pathologist records and anec- dotal notes. 11/11/2024 By February 2025, given direct instruction in Speech and Language and no more than 3 adult prompts, Beckett will develop his inferencing skills in novel problem-solving situations by using context clues and prior knowledge to make informed decisions and generate appropriate solutions in 75% of problem-solving tasks across 3 activities as measured quarterly by speech pathologist records and anec- dotal notes. 02/10/2025 Method of Reporting to Parent Quarterly Progress Reports Area of Need:Transition Implementation Personnel/Position Responsible: Special Education Teacher/ Special Education Support Staff/Speech Language Goal Date Created: 08/27/2024 IEP Page 12 of 25 Student Name: Beckett Pettit Lutton LEA DOB: 10/20/2005, SASID: 1336514843 SAU 31 Newmarket Present Level of Academic Achievement: On his most recent assessments (2022) on the Informal Measure of Nonverbal Language Pragmatic Checklist: CELF5 Beckett was scored as having “challenge areas” in the domains of: Trouble asking for help; Trouble asking questions; Trouble getting to the point when talking; Trouble expanding an answer. Currently, Beckett struggles signiﬁcantly with independent novel problem solving. For route, learned tasks and routines (library job, mail job, classroom routines) Beckett knows what is needed to be done a majority of the time and can problem solve or ask a familiar adult for help. For novel problem solving for situations where Beckett has no routine, however, he requires multiple adult cues to solve a prob- lem. He can only problem solve with adult assistance. Independently, Beckett will not consistently ask an adult for assistance and will wait an extraordinary amount of time before moving forward to solve the problem. At times he will abort the task all together. Present Functional Performance: Beckett struggles with novel problem solving.
