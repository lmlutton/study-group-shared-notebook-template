Transportation – This is for gas, bus, or taxi services. Per policy, VR will not reimburse the IRS rate; gas cost must be used. The calculation below should be used. The Travel Calculator (located in the Agency Links page in AWARE) should accompany these requests. Reimbursement amount = (miles driven/miles per gallon of vehicle) x current gas rate 2.) Advance Payment – An advance payment is used only when all attempts to pay a vendor directly are unsuccessful. All attempts must be made to use a State vendor or request that the vendor become a State vendor. 3.) Reimbursement – If the Counselor agrees, this is used to reimburse the participant for a purchase they made. There needs to be a cash receipt, cancelled check, or a copy of the bank or credit card statement in the Participant’s name to receive reimbursement. 4.) Financial Advocate* – If someone other than the Participant paid for services or goods directly and the counselor agrees to reimburse them for the purchases, a few items are required. There needs to be a written statement from the person who made the purchase explaining why the purchase was made, accompanied by one of the same items from #3 above. In addition, the VR18 needs to be filled out in the financial advocate’s name. *When paying a financial advocate, the payment must be marked as a manual payment in AWARE and the Central Office Account Tech needs to be notified. The Account Tech will need to print out the payment backup, make the vendor number “one-time” on the authorization and payment, and change the name and address on the authorization before the manual payment can be sent to the Business Office for processing. Field Purchase Order – Purchase of goods under $1,000.00 that are not purchasable using the Procurement Card (P-Card). P-Card Field Purchase Order – Purchase of goods under $1,000.00 from a vendor that accepts credit cards. (Can be used with State-contracted vendors) Purchase Order – Purchase of goods $1,000.00 and over. Services directly related to the purchase can be added to the Purchase Order as long as the service(s) are not over 50% of the total purchase order amount. For example, if the car repair is $2,000.00, the labor cannot be over $1,000.00. If it is, the service(s) needs to go on a separate service authorization. 3 P-Card Contract – Purchase of goods from Statewide contracts $1,000.00 and over. These follow the same process as Purchase Orders. However, services cannot be charged to the P-Card. Also, the ordering is to take place at Central Office. Service – Purchase of services. Services to Groups – This authorization type is located in the Groups module. This is used for purchasing of groups of items for an office. Purchases require Central Office approval. Examples include assessment forms and group benefit counseling. Group bus tickets are not allowed. Service Names All approved service names are listed in AWARE under HelpDesk/Service Categories. The services that a vendor provides can be found in the Vendor module in AWARE by searching for the vendor, then by clicking on services provided. In the HelpDesk module, you can see if a service has a rate associated with it. Also, in the Vendor module, you can see if a service has a rate that is specific to that vendor. Services and Associated Travel: Please make sure to use the travel time fee and mileage service names that go along with the category of the core service. See example and categories below: Example: The core service in AWARE is Disability-Related Skills Training – Rehab Teaching Blind. In this case, if mileage is needed, the mileage named Transportation Mileage – Disability Related Training would be selected. Specific Mileage/Travel Time Fee Services Transportation Mileage – Assessment Transportation Mileage – CRP Services Transportation Mileage – Disability Related Training Transportation Mileage – Rehab Technology Transportation Mileage – Training Transportation Mileage in the transportation category is only to be used for transportation of the Participant either by themselves or by a vendor Travel Time Fee – Assessment 4 Travel Time Fee – CRP Services Travel Time Fee – Disability Related Training Travel Time Fee – Rehab Technology Travel Time Fee – Training Shipping Add the cost of shipping into the purchase price of the item, or if needed, add a second line item for the original service name and list shipping in the description. Staff Authorization Roles Counselor or Rehab Tech – Creating a drafted authorization (an authorization in AWARE not marked ready for review or ready for issue) Counselor I, II, III or RL – Can mark an authorization ready for review Counselor II, III, or RL – Can mark an authorization ready for review/ready for issue Counselor III, or RL – Approval of Counselor I’s authorizations (either by way of Activity Due or using the financial layout “Authorizations to be Reviewed”) Central Office Account Tech – All authorizations marked ready for review and ready for issue will be reviewed daily for accuracy and then issued. Once issued the pdf version of the authorizations will be emailed to the regional office’s Rehab Tech and Regional Leader. Timelines for Authorizations No service should happen before an authorization is issued. An authorization should not be marked ready for review or ready for issue in AWARE if it is not ready to go to the vendor. This should be no sooner than 30 days prior to the service starting. Only services that begin within the quarter should be put forward for authorization with the exception of something that has to be in the hands of the vendor by the start of the next quarter. Authorization Timelines o All CRP services should be on a monthly timeframe, not to exceed one month. o Job Search/Job Development Package - If the start date is after the 15th of the month, it can go until the end of the next month. o Tuition & Fees should be authorized by semester. o Training should be authorized for no longer than one year. 5 o Placement/Retention bonuses should not be entered until the Participant has worked for 90 days. o On the Job Training should not be authorized in more than 30-day increments. o Hearing Aids should be authorized for 3-6 months. o Dental Restoration should be authorized no more than 6 months. o Prosthetics should be authorized no more than 6 months. Amending and Reopening Authorizations Rehab Tech/Central Office Account Tech – By using actions/amend on the authorization page, the quantity/amount/description can be amended for all authorizations except Purchase Orders. The Program Specialist must amend the Purchase Order authorizations. Program Specialist – By using actions/amend on the authorization, the quantity/amount/description can be amended for all authorization types including Purchase Orders. This is because the Program Specialist needs to amend the Purchase Order in NH First as well. Admin (Chris S./Kate) – Can update the vendor if needed. Reopening Closed Authorizations. – The Central Office Account Tech uses actions/reopen. Once reopened the authorization amount will be zero. The authorization will need to be amended to the correct amount. Choose reopening for the amendment reason. *This feature is not available in Groups, for Purchase Orders, or for authorizations in a different fiscal year.* *An authorization’s start date cannot be moved across fiscal years. For example, the dates of service are 10/5/16 - 11/30/16. No one can amend the authorization to change the start date to 9/30/16 as this would cross the fiscal year, and the system will not allow it.* Liquidations The unliquidated obligations (ULO) must be reviewed by the office Rehab Technicians at least once a month to look for authorizations that can be liquidated. Any authorization with an end date over 60 days is considered old. The office Rehab Technician should contact the vendor for an invoice and confirm that the service was provided. Authorizations should be liquidated (actions/cancel authorization in AWARE) only when the counselor and the vendor confirm the service did not and will not happen. Purchase Orders can only be cancelled by the Program Specialist. 6 Troubleshooting Services Not Showing up on the Authorization Below are common areas to check if a service is not populating on the authorization while the case is in service status or greater. 1.) No service can happen before the Signature/Start Date of the plan. Looking below, the plan was dated 10/15/2015. Therefore, the service selected for the authorization cannot have a start date before 10/15/2015. 2.) No service can happen before the Estimated Start Date on the plan. Looking below, the planned service start date is 10/2015; therefore, the service on the authorization cannot happen before 10/1/2015. Also, keep in mind the service still cannot happen before the plan Signature/Start Date. 3.) The vendor being used on the authorization must provide the service (can be found in the Vendor module under services provided). If the service is not listed for the vendor, email AWAREUAT@nh.gov to add the necessary service name. This service will not show up on the authorization if the begin date of the authorization is before 10/15/15 because of the plan signature date. 7 Purchasing Purchase Order Process 1. Obtain Three Quotes/Sole Source Justification – In accordance with State Purchasing rules, three quotes must be obtained for the purchase of products that are not purchased from State-contracted vendors. The three quotes or sole source justification must be documented in the “Other Comments” field on the authorization. NHVR is required to purchase from the vendor with the lowest quoted price. The class exceptions to this rule are Hearing Aids and Prosthetics (three quotes are not needed). Other exceptions are if the Participant is required to purchase from a specific vendor in order to attend specific trainings (example: cosmetology schools require students to purchase training materials from them directly). Sole source reasons:  A prescription through a doctor’s office  The items are required to be purchased through the school  A diagnostic fee was paid or a car was towed to a shop  Hearing aid or prosthetic  State-contracted vendor  Vendor is the only vendor who provides the product  Wheelchairs A list of State-contracted vendors is located at the address below. It is recommended but not required to use State-contracted vendors. https://das.nh.gov/purchasing/Contracts_posteddte.asp?sort=cna 2. Financial Needs Assessment (FNA) – An FNA signed within the last year must be attached to the Participant record in AWARE before a Purchase Order can be authorized. 3. Double Check Plan/Plan Amendment – Check the plan or plan amendment to assure the service is on the plan. 4. Purchase Order is drafted in AWARE – Counselor sends Activity Due to Rehab Tech to draft PO or Counselor will draft the PO. They will choose Purchase Order as the authorization type for goods over $1,000.00. The three quotes or sole source justification must be listed in the “Other Comments” box on the authorization. The three quotes must also be attached to the authorization. 8 5. Regional Leader Review and Approval – Once a Purchase Order is drafted in AWARE, the Counselor sends an Activity Due from the authorization page to the Regional Leader for review and approval. After the Regional Leader approves the authorization, and marks the authorization Ready for Review, they forward the Activity Due to the PO Program Specialist. 6. Purchase Order is Reviewed and Issued – The PO Program Specialist reviews their Activity Due for Purchase Orders daily. They check that an FNA is attached to the participant’s case in AWARE, the quotes are attached to the authorization, and the quotes or sole source justification is listed in the “Other Comments” field. They check that the vendor, quantity, and unit cost match the quote. They also add the Fund Source, Handling Code, and Ship to location. If all of the information is accurate, they mark the authorization as “Ready for Issue.” A final check of all the items is done. If all of the information is accurate, the PO is issued in AWARE only. The authorization in AWARE is not the Purchase Order. An official State Purchase Order is needed to go to the vendor. 7. Purchase Order is entered into NHFirst – After the PO is issued in AWARE, the information is entered into NHFirst to generate the Official State PO. 8. State Purchase Order is released – The Program Specialist reviews the information entered into NHFirst for accuracy. If all of the information is accurate, the State PO is released. After it has been released, the State PO is emailed to the corresponding Rehab Tech (with a cc to the Central Office Account Tech) to send to the vendor. Also, the PO number is updated in AWARE on the authorization page. Procurement Cards (P-Cards) Procurement cards are agency chip-enabled Visa credit cards. Each card is issued with a unique PIN number that may be required at certain vendors. These cards are only used for the purchase of goods for VR participants. Each regional office should have at least two designated cardholders. These cardholders are responsible for their own card and its transactions. Below is a list of guidelines pertaining to the P-Card and its use:  P-Cards should not be used to purchase goods for a participant without an issued authorization.  Three quotes are required to be attached to the P-Card authorization with the exception of clothing, prescriptions, or items under $100.00.  P-Card transactions cannot be combined to make a purchase of greater than $1,000.00. 9  Purchases of goods over $1,000.00 from Statewide contracts that accept P-Cards follow the same process as Purchase Orders. However, services cannot be charged to the P-Card. Also, the ordering is to take place at Central Office.  Online orders for participants are to take place in Central Office. Online orders should be a last resort.  Card information should only be given to vendors via mail, phone, or fax. Card information should never be emailed as this is not secure.  Upon purchase and within 1 day of receipt, the payment needs to be processed in AWARE. Field Purchase Order & P-Card FPO Purchasing When purchasing a product that is under $1,000.00, either a Field Purchase Order (FPO) or P-Card Field Purchase Order authorization is used. The FPO must be dated on or before date of purchase. No FPO’s should be done after the purchase has been made. Three quotes are required and must be attached to the authorization for these purchases with the exception of clothing, prescriptions, required books or supplies purchased at a school or institute, or for items less than $100.00. A signed FPO must be attached to the payment in AWARE and the amount listed on the FPO must match the invoice and/or receipt. Online Ordering Online orders for participants are to take place in Central Office. All online accounts are handled there to allow for account tracking. These orders should be a last resort. If it has been determined that an online order needs to be placed, the following process occurs: 1. A signed, issued FPO is sent to the staff member responsible for online ordering by email. 2. The authorization is reviewed to confirm the shipping address and the three quotes are reviewed (if necessary). 3. The item(s) is added to the cart and the billing and shipping information is updated. 4. The cart is sent to the Office Rehab Tech to ensure the correct items have been selected and the shipping address is correct. 5. If the information is correct, the order is placed. 6. All information regarding the order is sent to the Office Rehab Tech to be used when making the payment. 7. Once the item(s) is received, the payment should be processed in AWARE within one day. (See the P-Card payment process for more information on payments) Car Repairs Three quotes are required for car repairs unless the vehicle had to be towed to the garage or if the garage requires payment of a diagnostic fee; in this case only one quote and FNA are required. Vehicle Repairs 10 and Labor are to be separate plan line items. Labor can be added to a Purchase Order as long as the labor is not more than 50% of the part cost; otherwise, a separate service authorization is created for the labor. Car Repair Policy a. Prior to agreeing to pay for a car repair, the VR counselor must determine that the vehicle can legally be driven and that the driver can legally drive. b. Automobile repairs will not be supported until after an IPE has been developed and approved. c. Proof of registration will be provided prior to vehicle repair. d. Prior to IPE implementation counselors and Participants will find other means to meet the Participant’s transportation need. e. NHVR will not pay for routine maintenance. Routine maintenance includes tune-ups, oil changes, tire rotation, tire replacements, fluids, filters, spark plugs, light bulbs, and wipers. f. VR support for car repair is limited to $2,000.00 for the lifetime of the case including post- employment services including amendments or no greater than the total blue book value of the car per Participant during the lifetime of the case including post-employment services. *See NHVR policy for the complete car repair policy. Computer Hardware/Software Purchases NHVR shall purchase a computer or computer technology, which includes devices such as iPads and tablets for a Participant’s schooling only when the computer is necessary due to the Participant’s disability. If considering a Computer, iPad, Technology, Software, etc. for a Participant, follow the steps below: Computer/technology should not be included in a plan until the following is completed (documentation that the computer is necessary due to a disability):  An assessment was completed by an Occupational Therapist, Assistive Tech, or other Rehab Technology professional  The assessment identifies the specific disability-related rehabilitation need (hardware, software)  The technology is required for their employment goal If the above three statements are true, 1. Attach assessment to AWARE 2. Create a case note detailing why the technology that is being considered is required for the Participant to successfully complete their IPE (Case Note Category – Waiver Request / Justification) 3. Check to see if a loaner computer is available and if that will meet the needs identified in the assessment 4. Review with RL the necessity of the technology (Activity Due to RL) 5. If approved by RL – Gather 3 quotes, or a state-contracted vendor, or provide a sole source justification 6. Write plan or plan amendment 11 7. Draft authorization (do not click ready for review/ready to issue) and add the service name. You will not be able to go above $1.00. 8. Send an Activity Due to Chris Semonelli to do final approval and change the authorization amount to reflect the actual quote received 9. Once the authorization amount is updated, the counselor can mark ready for review/issue on the authorization *If the participant specifically needs the software for the school (CAD software; university specific version of software) this falls under the ITA Rate when purchasing. Home Modification Process All Home Modifications must go through the Field Services Administrator for approval prior to authorization. 12 1. Notify RL that vehicle mod is anticipated 2. If a wheelchair is used-ensure that it will not be replaced in the near future 3. Refer participant for a Driving Evaluation and enter authorization 4.

All invoices must include the items listed below. If these items are missing, a new invoice should be requested from the vendor.  Participant’s Name  Date(s) of Service  Service being provided  Vendor Name  Vendor’s Address When paying from a receipt, the receipt must be taped to an 8 ½” by 11” sheet of paper. Please do not put tape over any of the print as it becomes illegible. If the receipt is double sided, please make sure to photocopy the back before taping it to the paper. Once the invoices are marked “Ok to Pay” by the counselor, they are scanned and attached to the payment record in AWARE. The immediate payment check box on the payment in AWARE is used for invoices over 30 days old, participant payments, or if a special circumstance arises. If a payment needs to be rushed, please email the Central Office Account Tech. Please include a reason for the rush. An appropriate reason would be the participant needs a pair of boots before work that starts next week. P-Card Payments in AWARE P-Card payments follow the same rules and guidelines as regular payments. However, there are a few more requirements specific to these payments:  Upon purchase and within 1 day of receipt, the payment needs to be processed in AWARE.  Orders that are shipped need to be processed as soon as the order arrives.  The payment attachment should include: o Invoice with “OK to Pay” and participant’s full name listed o Signed P-Card FPO or P-Card Contract authorization o Packing slip, R&I, or initials with the date the customer received the item(s) listed on the invoice  The naming convention of the attachment should be as follows: Participant ID_Auth #_Invoice #_Invoice Date Example: 61716_4156632_1234_020317  P-Card payments cannot be viewed in NH First as final payments are processed by Central Office using an online system hosted by Bank of America. 14 Payment Roles and information A payment in AWARE has three levels of approval. When none of the boxes listed below are checked, the payment is considered to be a draft. Drafted payments should be monitored and should be deleted if they are no longer valid, or they should be marked ready for review to keep the payment moving. Ready for Review – This check box is selected after a Rehab Tech attaches the necessary backup to the payment record and feels the payment is correct and ready for review by the Central Office Account Technician. Approved for Release – This check box is selected after the Central Office Account Technician reviews the payment for accuracy. Ready for Release – This check box is selected after the Central Office staff who have final approval have reviewed the payment for accuracy and the payment is ready to be uploaded to NHFirst. The Central Office Program Specialist releases payments daily and as often as necessary. Once a payment has been released, the information below can be found on the payment in AWARE. Date Sent to Accounting System – This is when the payment was uploaded to NHFirst. If the payment is manual, this is the day the process began in Central Office to code the payment to be manually sent to the DOE Office of Business Management. Fund Code & ALI – These two sections identify which fund source was used for the payment. Warrant Number – This is the voucher number in NH First, which can be easily looked up in the AP90.3 screen. Warrant Date – This is the voucher date. Voucher Number – This is the check number. 15 Manual Payments Purchase Order payments and any payment made to another State Agency need to be marked manual in AWARE, as these payments cannot be uploaded to NH First. To mark a payment manual, select the “Manual” check box on the payment page in AWARE. After manual payments are released, a report is generated the next day detailing the payment information for Central Office staff to manually process the payment. Once payments are processed by Central Office staff, they are submitted to the DOE Office of Business Management for final processing in NH First. Payment Pulls from Release Payments are reviewed daily and any payments that are incorrect or have any errors will be “pulled.” Once it has been determined that the payment must be pulled, all of the approval boxes on the payment will be unchecked, and the reason the payment was pulled will be listed in the “Other Comments” box. Once the payments are pulled, an email is sent to the corresponding office Rehab Technician with the authorization number and the reason the payment was pulled. Issues and errors should be corrected as soon as possible. All pulled payments can be located using the layout drafted payments in the financial module. Below is a list of the reasons a payment can be pulled. Batch Pull Reasons If there is a problem with one or more of the following, the payment may need to be pulled: 1. Attached Invoice - Payment should have an invoice attached. It is ok to have an invoice attached to payment 1 that covers payment 1, 2, 3, and 4 etc. Invoice attached should be from the authorized vendor for the authorized service. 2. Ok to Pay – All invoices must have “OK to Pay” and the initials of the Counselor or Regional Leader on them. 3. Vendor – Check that the Vendor in AWARE matches the Vendor on the Invoice.  If the invoice has a different REMIT TO address than AWARE has please work with AWAREUAT@nh.gov to correct it. 4. Service – Check that the service on the invoice matches the service in AWARE. Abbreviations are fine as long as they are easily recognized.  If service name is Other Services then a description of the service must be noted.  Same category/type of service at times will be ok. Example: Driver Training/Driver Ed Classroom training/Driver education Road Training 5. Invoice Number – Make sure the invoice number on the vendor invoice is being used and is correct.  Please make sure to use no symbols, spaces, or leading zeros in invoice numbers. (e.g. -, &, #, etc. 16  For vendors that do not use invoice numbers, we will typically use the auth number unless there is something else the vendor prefers. Example: Neurobehavioral Service likes it when we use their voucher number or the Community College System of NH needs us to use the initials of the college before any numbers we key in. 6. Invoice Dates – Make sure the invoice date from the vendor invoice is being used.  Some vendors do not date their invoices so we will use other dates such as the date the invoice was stamped in or the date the Participant/Vendor signed it.  All invoices must be date stamped when arriving in the office.  Invoice date should not be before the dates of service unless it is a specific service that needs to be paid ahead of time. 7. Dates of Service – The vendor invoice must list the date(s) of service. Check that the dates of service on the vendor invoice fall within the dates of service on the AWARE authorization. The payment page should match the dates of service on the invoice. 8. Partial Pay of Invoice – When only paying some of the invoice lines the invoice needs to state how the other portion of the invoice is being paid. If possible, an authorization should be amended and a service added instead of paying only a portion of an invoice.  Example: Mileage paid on auth 157659 3/7/2016; the item not being paid is neatly crossed off 9. Participant – Check that the participant’s name on the vendor invoice is the same Participant the payment is being made for. 10. Amount to be paid – Check that the amount being paid in AWARE matches the amount the counselor is paying for.  NHVR will never pay over the GSA mileage rate for vendor mileage. 2019 = .58  Interpreters will always be paid at the GSA mileage rate.  The State will never pay late fees.  Vocational Rehabilitation is exempt from paying NH State taxes. 11. SEP – Is the Participant coded Supported Employment on their plan? If so, make sure the CRP services being used are for SEP participants. SEP services may not be used for non-Supported Employment participants 12. Pre-ETS – When using a Pre-ETS service make sure the end date of the service is no greater than the end date of the goal (located on the education page). They must be marked as a SWD in the system. 13. Participant Payments – Make sure the Participant’s name and address information on the VR-18 form matches the name and address in the Vendor module in AWARE. If the warrant address does not match AWARE, please check Lawson. Also, make sure the appropriate back up is attached when the Participant is being reimbursed for something.  A mileage calculation needs to be shown on the VR-18 or a travel calculator sheet needs to be attached. The gas rate should be reasonable for the VR-18 sign date. 17  The VR-18 needs to be signed and dated by the participant. 14. Manual Payments – The following must always be marked as “Manual Payment”  Purchase Orders  Any payment to another State Agency  Reimbursement payments to a Financial Advocate  If you have something marked “Manual Pay” that does not fall under this list it should be questioned.  The appropriate PO/FPO backup needs to be in the manual payment bin before the payment will be approved in AWARE. 15. FPO Payments - All goods under $1,000.00 must be on an FPO. When paying an FPO the attachments should be:  Vendor Invoice  R&I/Packing Slip/or statement that says the Participant received the item(s) on a specific date along with VR staff initials.

Open: Check is outstanding Reconcile: Check is cashed Other Vendors All new vendors are recommended to register via Purchasing’s website located at: https://das.nh.gov/purchasing/vendorregistration Existing vendors should update their information online. An A-22 can be sent to PRCH.WEB@das.nh.gov to update vendor information as well. If needed, an Alt W-9 can be completed and faxed to Purchasing. Once all is completed, if a change is needed in AWARE, please email AWAREUAT@nh.gov. Before vendors are added to AWARE, the System for Award Management (SAM), maintained by the federal government, is reviewed to ensure the vendor is not currently debarred. (https://www.sam.gov/SAM/) When searching for a vendor using SAM, vendors that have “Exclusion” 22 in purple listed next to their name are currently debarred. Those that have “Entity” in green next to their name do not have exclusions. Yearly a list of debarred vendors is compared to the active vendors in AWARE. Participants as Vendors To get a vendor code for the participant so they may receive a payment in AWARE, the office Rehab Tech needs to fill out an A-22 form with the Participant’s information including their participant ID. The completed form is emailed to AWAREUAT@nh.gov. The information will be entered into NHFirst by the responsible staff member. The next day, AWARE will update this information and a payment can be made. NH First Vendor Information Vendor and Vendor Locations – AP10.1 (Vendor) and AP10.2 (Locations) 23 24 In-State Travel  All travel forms are located on the DOE intranet http://hzndoevapp03p/intranet/ There is also a “Travel Book of Basics” available to assist employees in completing the required forms on the intranet.  All employees are required to file reimbursement requests within 30 days after the trip with the exception of fiscal year-end (June 30). During fiscal year-end, employees are required to submit requests immediately upon return from the trip. The travel submittal schedule will be emailed during the fiscal year-end time frame.  Expenditures for business-related travel parking shall be reimbursed, and receipts for such parking shall not be required unless the charge is greater than $5.00. All receipts must be taped to an 8 ½’’ x 11’’ piece of paper and submitted with the travel voucher.  A Certificate of Travel (A-38) is required if a work assignment is away from the employee’s official headquarters and it is more efficient for the employee to proceed directly from/to the place of residence to/from an assigned work site without reporting to their headquarters. The A-38 must be signed by the employee and the employee’s direct supervisor.  Should an individual pass through their official headquarters while traveling directly to an assigned work site from and/or to their place of residence, one way or round trip commuter miles shall be deducted from the miles to be reimbursed.  Tolls need to be specified, as in Hampton toll, Hooksett toll; it cannot simply list toll.

Note the name of City, Deduction of commuter miles, and the toll name. Note the signature of the employee, vendor code, title, official headquarters, residence, and the date it is completed to Central Office. 25 Out-of-State Travel An Employee must submit a request for Out-of-State Travel to their supervisor at least two weeks prior to the anticipated travel. The required form is located on the DOE intranet http://hzndoevapp03p/intranet/. All Out-of-State Travel needs prior approval from the Director. Supply Ordering Office supply orders occur on the first Wednesday of every month. These orders should be accompanied by a “P-Card Request Form.” The request forms are to be done electronically; they should not be submitted handwritten. All orders must be approved by the director via the “P-Card Request Form” before the order is placed. In anticipation of this, these forms should be submitted as soon as possible so there is no delay in ordering. Submit all P-Card Request Forms to Central Office to check for completeness and get approval on the orders. P-Card Request Forms must be accompanied by a quote or print out of the cart. Any orders requested after the first Wednesday will not be placed until the following month. Should an emergency situation occur during the month, the office Regional Leader will need to submit the order request to Lisa Hinson-Hatz for approval with an explanation. Postage Postage requests will be treated the same as a typical supply order, with the exception of sending certified letters for the order of selection. When requesting to send certified mail, follow the outlined process below: 1. Email the respective Central Office contacts a “P-Card Request Form” with the number of letters you need to send and an estimated cost. You will receive an email back with approval to send the letters. 2. Use your P-Card to send the certified letters. 3. Send the receipt to the respective Central Office contact once the purchase has been made via email. Stamp purchases are tracked in Central Office. Inventory All goods purchased for an office that cost over $250.00 (per item) are recorded in the Department’s inventory system and assigned a State Tag number. Any transfer of goods from one area or person to another needs to be documented and reported to the respective Central Office contact. A full physical inventory is to be done yearly led by Central Office. 26 Pre-Employment Transition Services Tracking in AWARE Federal regulations require Vocational Rehabilitation programs to expend at least 15% of the 110 formula grant on Pre-Employment Transition Services pursuant to section 110(d)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by WIOA. Pre-Employment Transition Services are broken up into five categories: 1. Job Exploration Counseling 2. Work-based learning experiences, which may include in-school, after school, or community-based opportunities 3. Counseling on opportunities for enrollment in comprehensive transition or postsecondary educational programs at Institutes of Higher Education 4. Workplace readiness training to develop social skills and independent living 5. Instruction in self-advocacy, including peer mentoring For Potentially Eligible Individuals A student does not need to apply for VR services if they are only receiving Pre-Employment Transition Services and are not in need of any other VR services. Eight (8) data elements will still need to be tracked and reported quarterly. These Potentially Eligible Individuals cases (PTS cases in AWARE) are entered in AWARE by Central Office or the Student Transition Specialist Counselors. The eight (8) data elements recorded are: 1.) Unique Identifier (automatically created by AWARE which includes the Participant ID) 2.) Social Security Number (if available) 3.) Date of Birth 4.) Race – Required if student is in elementary or secondary education 5.) Ethnicity – Required if student is in elementary or secondary education 6.) Student with a Disability 7.) Start Date of Pre-Employment Transition Services 8.) Pre-Employment Transition Services with service type, service provider, and expenditure amount. For all Potentially Eligible Individuals, the following documentation is required to verify that they have a disability and therefore are potentially eligible for services: a.) Case note documenting counselor observation, review of school records, statements of education staff; or b.) Referral form for pre-employment transition services with the identification of a student’s disability, signed by school staff; or c.) Copy of an individualized education program (IEP) document, SSA beneficiary award letter, school psychological assessment, documentation of a diagnosis or disability determination, or documentation relating to 504 accommodation(s). Expenditure Tracking in AWARE for all Pre-Employment Transition Services 27 When payments are released in the AWARE system, the fund allocation batch process assigns the payment with the activity of 56_90F20PET if the service is flagged as a service specific to students with disabilities and the participant is between the ages 14-21 and they are currently or were in an educational setting during the dates of service. The activity signifies which grant is being spent as well as flags the expenditure as Pre-ETS, and the NH DOE Business Office uses the activity to post and reconcile the ledgers monthly to report the Pre-ETS expenditures. Once an allotment for the 110 grant award is received, the DOE Business Office sets aside 15% of the allotment for Pre-Employment Transition Services. The 15% is marked on the bottom section of the RECAP page in the ledger for Accounting Unit 2538. The RECAP page is reviewed monthly to evaluate the remaining balance of the 15% of designated Pre-ETS monies. The CL 603 page in the ledgers is reviewed on a monthly basis against AWARE to ensure that payment totals, including Pre-ETS, match and are posted correctly by the DOE Business Office. Time Allocation and Applicable Transfers of Expenditures Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors and Vocational Rehabilitation Supervisors Time Allocation: As federally required, Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors and Vocational Rehabilitation Supervisors must track time spent on the provision of Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) to students with disabilities. Time tracking is facilitated in the AWARE case management system by use of the Actual Service feature. Staff will use the Actual Service data page to record services provided to a specific participant. This data page includes the date the service was provided, the type of service provided, who provided the service, the amount of time spent providing the service, and a description of the service. If needed, staff also record a case note in the participant’s case including more specific information regarding the service provided to accompany the actual service record. Staff are expected to record the actual service and accompanying case note (if needed) in the case management system within fourteen (14) days of the service being provided to ensure accurate information is being reported. Transfer of Expenditures: On a quarterly basis, Actual Service data entries related to Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) recorded in the AWARE case management system are extracted using Tableau. The list of Actual Services provided is reviewed by a Transition team member for content and accuracy. Once the actual service report is reviewed and approved, VR staff will work with the Office of Business Management on a quarterly basis to calculate the value of the recorded staff time and transfer that portion of salary and benefits to be allocated using designated Pre-ETS money (to be done in conjunction with other Pre-ETS staff time transfer of expenditures). Student Transition Specialist Counselors and other staff Time Allocation: 28 As federally required, Student Transition Specialists (STS) Counselors and other applicable staff must track time spent on the provision of Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) to students with disabilities who are deemed potentially eligible to receive Vocational Rehabilitation services. Time tracking is captured in an Excel spreadsheet that follows the State’s bi-weekly pay schedule. Staff are to record the date the service was provided, the type of service provided, the amount of time spent providing the service, and a description of the service in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is submitted bi-weekly to their supervisor. The supervisor compares the spreadsheet to the employee’s electronic timecard to check for discrepancies. If there are no discrepancies, the supervisor will approve the employee’s electronic timecard as well as print and sign the spreadsheet. Signed spreadsheets are kept in a binder for each six (6) month increment and organized by counselor. Transfer of Expenditures: The electronic version of the STS counselor’s approved time tracking spreadsheet is kept on a restricted file on the Shared Drive. VR staff compiles the data from all spreadsheets monthly into a master spreadsheet. On a quarterly basis, VR will work with the Office of Business Management to calculate the value of the recorded staff time and transfer that portion of salary and benefits to be allocated using designated Pre-ETS money (to be done in conjunction with other Pre-ETS staff time transfer of expenditures). Staff Time Allocation VR Staff located under the Office of Business Management (OBM) Time Allocation: VR staff located under OBM are required to allocate their time between the various non-vocational rehabilitation programs they are responsible for. Staff time is tracked using an Excel spreadsheet created by the Office of Business Management. Transfer of Expenditures: On a quarterly basis, the VR staff will prepare a transfer of expenditures that is submitted to the Office of Business Management for processing. Outlook appointments and meeting notes are used as back up to the hours spent on the different programs. Blind Services Administrator and Blind Services Coordinator Time Allocation: Both the Blind Services Administrator and Blind Services Coordinator positions are paid out of State Accounting Unit 25440000. They divide their time between the Older Blind program and the VR program. A memo is completed quarterly to document the percentage of time for each program. The time spent on the VR program is used towards the Maintenance of Effort. All Remaining Staff Members Time Allocation: According to 2 CFR 200.403, “Any employee funded by federal grants must maintain documentation showing that their time is allocable to a federal program.” Semiannually (January 1st and July 1st) time and effort certificates are sent to Bureau staff for review and signature. The certificates certify that 100% of 29 the employee’s time and effort was spent on their designated federal program. Supervisors also sign these certificates to confirm that the employee spent 100% of their time and effort on their designated federal program. These certificates are managed by Central Office staff and filed for auditing purposes.* *Please refer to Standard Operating Procedure DOE-BVR-001, entitled “Employee Time and Effort Reporting - Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation” for the Bureau’s complete time and effort procedure. Cash Receipts For Refunds, Overpayments, and Returned State Checks If a check is received in a Regional Office for a refund, overpayment, or the check is returned, it is sent to Central Office to be deposited. Refunds and overpayments are entered into AWARE for tracking in the refund module. To complete a refund, select the refund module, choose new, enter in whom the check was received from, either the vendor or participant’s name, and the reason for the refund. Next, the refund detail is selected. This will allow for proper expenditure reporting on the case. Once the refund in AWARE is completed, the check needs to be deposited (see depositing section below). If a State of New Hampshire check is returned, the same procedure is followed, but the check is not deposited into NH First; the check is returned to the Office of Business Management and they will process the deposit in NH First. For Participant Contribution In some cases, participants have an agreed upon amount that they will contribute for an item that was purchased. Checks received from the participant are tracked in AWARE using Case Notes. A new case note is created on the participant’s case using the category Participant Participation and in the summary listing the amount and date. Once this is completed, the checks can be deposited. See depositing section below. Interpreter Licensing and Certification Checks for interpreter licensing and certification are processed the same way in NH First. The only difference is the account information and the user fields. Nothing needs to be done in AWARE. SSA Checks for Ticket to Work and Cost Reimbursement Treasury notifies us by email when VR funds have arrived from SSA. We also receive a payment processing report from SSA/Maximus. The payments on the report are matched to the payments on the Treasury notification prior to making a deposit. The deposit date is the date that Treasury received the funds, not the date listed on the payment processing report. The only difference with depositing these checks is the account information and user fields. Nothing needs to be done in AWARE. Depositing of Non-State Checks 30 Open the AR20 screen in NH First. You will see the screen below. Fill out all of the fields below except for the Batch field. For most deposits, the Cash Code will be 0012 and the Pay Code will be DEP.

Once in the report, verify your account number, revenue source, total amount, and count of checks. 34 Click on view options button at the top of the screen, choose PDF landscape, and print the PDF. Make a copy of the checks and the report. Open up the AR24.1 screen. AR24.1 Once in the AR24.1 screen go to the position to field and type in your batch number, then choose Inquire. After you choose Inquire your batch will appear on the top line; choose S for submit in the FC Box; then choose the “Submit for Approval” box. A dialog pop-up box will appear and will say your batch number has been submitted for approval. 35 Sending report to OBM Once the program income is deposited in NH First (Ticket, Cost Reimbursement, and Participant Participation) and is ready to go to OBM, all deposits are immediately applied against payroll, class 10, and benefits, class 60. This information is tracked using the Common Accounting Number (CAN) _90 SSI. Doing this allows the program income to be expended before any administrative cash draws take place. Data Backdating procedures in AWARE AWARE will allow for backdating for up to 14 days. This is to allow case information to remain current and federal report submission to remain timely. Actual Services – 14 days Application Date – 14 days Eligibility Date – 14 days Eligibility Extension – 14 days Trial Work – 14 days Plan or Amended Plan Date – 14 days Employment – 14 days Closure – 14 days Date override process Dates can still be overridden by the Data Unit but only once an Activity Due to Christopher Semonelli is received with a description on why the date change needs to occur. This will only be allowed partially into the next quarter. Reopening Cases Once a case has been closed and that information has been submitted (quarterly) the case should not be reopened. This is especially important as we will not be able to pay any invoices on that case once it has been closed and reported. It is the office’s responsibility to make the vendors aware that if they provide any type of service without an authorization, payment will not be guaranteed. It is also the responsibility 36 of the office to verify with the vendor that no service was provided before liquidating any authorization or closing a case. Closed Files Closed files must be delivered to Central Office within 60 days of the closure date. Please coordinate with the Data Unit if the office cannot meet this timeframe. Files will be monitored for timeliness in the Data Unit.
