Portal access is found on the VRNH website on the Apply for VR Services page or through this link: https://nhdoeconsumer.awareportals.com/. Referral After making a referral, the user can log in to the Portal to view their referral information or the information of the individual they referred. This information includes the referral’s name, address and contact information, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, reported disability, as well as their Referral ID and Referral Status. A parent, school, or other entity can refer more than one individual for VR services using the same email address and Portal account. They may view the information for the individuals they have referred to VR as well as view the status of the referrals. Consumer (After Application for Services) In addition, the Portal can be used by individuals that have applied for VR services. The individual may request access to the portal from their Counselor at or after application for services.
