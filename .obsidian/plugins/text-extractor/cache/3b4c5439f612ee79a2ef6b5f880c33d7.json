The information you provide helps Student Accessibility Services (SAS) understand the nature and impacts of a student's disability. SAS reviews what you provide, along with the student's self-report and other information, to determine: If the student is qualified to receive accommodations What accommodations are reasonable Without appropriate documentation, SAS cannot proceed with the accommodation process, so accurate, recent, and thorough information is critical. Key Tips for Providers Completing Documentation Be thorough and specific Include all relevant assessments and diagnostic information Ensure any assessments and data included are recent (see criteria below) Review the documentation review criteria before sharing (see criteria below) Complete all sections of the Provider Verification Form Submitting Documentation to SAS Preferred Option Provider completes the Provider Verification Form SAS Accommodation Request: Provider Verification Form Alternative Option Student submits Letters and Assessment Reports from the provider Accommodate Student Portal • • • • • • • UNH Student Accessibility Services Smith Hall, Room 227 Phone 603.862.2607 • TTY Users 7-1-1 sas.office@unh.edu • www.unh.edu/sas GENERAL DOCUMENTATION CRITERIA There are a wide range of reasons why a provider might submit documentation that meets the criteria for the general criteria. This includes requests for: Academic accommodations Parking and transportation accommodations Dining accommodations This information will assist SAS in determining which accommodations are reasonable for the individual student. Please note: this documentation could also be sufficient for housing accommodations, but providers may choose to submit housing-only documentation in certain cases. General Documentation Review Criteria Basic Criteria Be on official letterhead, dated, typed, and in English Be written by a licensed provider Must come from a professional with an existing relationship to the student Include information about the student diagnosis Include any current, objective assessment data to support the diagnosis Detail the functional limitations, including the severity of said limitations Discuss any relevant accommodation history Detail the connection between the functional implications and the accommodations being requested by the student Recency Criteria ADHD, LD, ASD, ID - within 5 years Psychological, TBI - within 1 year Health, Sensory - variable depending on condition permanence • • • • • • • • • • • • • • UNH Student Accessibility Services UNH Student Accessibility Services Smith Hall, Room 227 Phone 603.862.2607 • TTY Users 7-1-1Phone 603.862.2607 • TTY Users 7-1-1 sas.office@unh.edu sas.office@unh.edu • • www.unh.edu/saswww.unh.edu/sas HOUSING-ONLY DOCUMENTATION CRITERIA Documentation for housing-only requests requires a different standard of documentation. Accommodation processes for housing fall within the Fair Housing Act, and as such, SAS requires different types of information. Generally, we would like to know more about: The nature of the condition The functional impact of the condition Connection to housing accommodations Please note: documentation that only meets the housing-only standard may not be sufficient for meeting the ADA standard of documentation. Please contact SAS with any questions about what documentation is appropriate to submit. Housing-Only Documentation Review Criteria Basic Criteria Be on official letterhead, dated, typed, and in English Must come from a professional with an existing relationship to the student Provide information about the specific functional impacts of the condition Detail the relationship between the condition and the accommodation request In regards to Emotional Support Animals (ESA) this can also include information on work the animal does, tasks performed, and type of assistance • • • • • • • • • • • Recency Criteria ADHD, LD, ASD, ID - within 5 years Psychological, TBI - within 1 year Health, Sensory - variable depending on condition permanence UNH Student Accessibility Services Smith Hall, Room 227 Phone 603.862.2607 • TTY Users 7-1-1 sas.office@unh.edu • www.unh.edu/sas FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FROM PROVIDERS Does SAS have to implement all the accommodations a provider recommends? No. SAS is not under any obligation to directly implement the accommodations as you recommend. SAS works with students through an interactive process to determine accommodations. Documentation is an important aspect of that process, but, ultimately, SAS determines what accommodations are appropriate for the specific educational context. Can a provider write a letter of support? As a provider you can write a letter of support, but this is not the ideal method of documentation submission for general documentation. However, if you do choose to write a letter, that letter will need to meet our review criteria for documentation. If writing a letter of support, please refer directly to our review criteria. If your letter does not meet the review criteria, then the student will need to request more documentation from you. This could result in a delay in the accommodation process. Who can providers contact with documentation questions? We prefer that you first connect with the student you are working with about any questions related to documentation. Ultimately, the student is responsible for providing SAS with documentation, so it is important that they are directly involved in helping navigate this process. Is a family member allowed to provide documentation for a student? No. Documentation cannot be submitted by a family member. The individual submitting the documentation should have a professional relationship with the student.
