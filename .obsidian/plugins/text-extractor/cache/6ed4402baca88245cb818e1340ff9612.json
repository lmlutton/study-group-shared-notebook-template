Enrolling students should have all official college transcripts and official examination results sent directly to the UNH Admissions Office (CEEB#: 3918) An official credit evaluation will be completed and posted to DegreeWorks within your MyUNH account. You will be able to view the total credits awarded and Discovery requirements that have been fulfilled. Please note that it is up to each UNH academic department to determine which courses from other institutions will be accepted towards fulfilling academic major requirements. Credit award is communicated to the student’s college dean, academic advisor, and the Registrar’s office. For course credit to transfer from another institution of higher education, the following criteria must be met: • The course was taken at an institution fully accredited by a regional association of schools and colleges. • The minimum grade earned in the class was at least a \"C\" or its equivalent. • The course was not remedial or vocational in nature or taken as part of a certificate program. • Mathematics coursework must be completed at the Pre-Calculus level or higher (i.e. Finite Mathematics, Statistics, Calculus) to transfer. No credit is awarded for mathematics courses which duplicate high school level Algebra or below. • To receive credit for elementary level world language coursework, a student cannot have completed two or more years of study in that same language in high school. Intermediate level world language coursework and above is eligible for transfer credit.
