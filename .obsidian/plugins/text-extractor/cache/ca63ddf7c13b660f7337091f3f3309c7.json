Order of Selection 6 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 301 Revision # 1 Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date 1/3/2024 Agency Strategic Direction I. DESCRIPTION: This policy states the Mission, Philosophy, Principles, Values, and Vision of the Agency and provides overall strategic guidance to the staff of the bureau. It is intended to plainly state the bureau’s values and motivate staff to reach further. Vision and mission are key components of leadership. VRNH strives to create an environment where everyone can know and understand the vision, mission, and values and use these to direct their work toward achieving the organization’s mission. II. DEFINITIONS: Mission: The mission statement conveys the primary purpose of the agency, i.e., the reason for its existence. The mission guides organizational decisions, policies, and activities (internal and external) on a daily basis. The mission statement outlines what the agency is now. It focuses on today; it identifies the customer(s); it identifies the critical process(es); and it states the level of performance. Philosophy: The Agency’s philosophy statement articulates the accepted beliefs (or system of beliefs) that guide the work of the Agency. The philosophy states what VRNH believes to be true. Principles: Principles are the fundamental beliefs or values that we seek to accept and use to direct and govern our behavior as an organization. Principles identify a beginning, or a foundation upon which the activities of the Agency are based. Service Promise: A set of tangible guidelines that help to define a) what a customer can expect from interactions with your business, and b) how that experience should be delivered by the frontline. It focuses squarely on customers by outlining the type of experience they will have and how the company will deliver it every time. Values: Values are the assumptions, convictions, or beliefs about the manner in which people should behave and the principles that should govern behavior. Values represent the deeply held beliefs within the organization and are demonstrated through the day-to-day behaviors of all employees. An organization’s values make an open proclamation about how it expects everyone to behave. Values should endure over the long term and provide a constant source of strength for the organization. Vision: A vision statement outlines what a company wants to be. It focuses on tomorrow; it is inspirational; it provides clear decision-making criteria; and it is timeless. It has been said that a vision is something to be pursued, while a mission is something to be accomplished. 7 2 III. POLICY: The Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation maintains policy on mission and vision to provide personnel with a common sense of purpose. 1. Mission Our mission is to partner and collaborate with individuals and businesses to maximize the employment and career opportunities, self-sufficiency, and workforce potential of people with disabilities. 2. Service Promise Our service promise to you: Your goal is our priority. 3. Philosophy Work is a valued activity for individuals and society. We believe work fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America. Disability is a natural part of human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to live independently, enjoy self- determination, make choices, contribute to society, pursue meaningful careers, and enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society. Increased employment of individuals with disabilities can be achieved through the provision of individualized training, independent living services, educational and support services, and meaningful opportunities for employment in competitive integrated work settings through the provision of reasonable accommodations. 4. Principles The principles that guide the VRNH service delivery system include respect for individual dignity, personal responsibility, self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers. These principles are based on informed choice; respect for privacy, rights, and equal access; inclusion, integration, and full participation of individuals with disabilities. They also support the involvement of the family, advocates or authorized representatives, if desired or requested by the individual with a disability, and support for individual and systematic advocacy and community involvement. 5. Values We value respect, integrity, equity, responsiveness, and resourcefulness. 6. Vision Our vision is to become ever more adaptive to emerging customer needs by designing and delivering contemporary, innovative, and responsive tools that support employment and career opportunities. Procedure: There is no related procedure to this policy. 8 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 302 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 3 Last Reviewed/Update Date None General Provisions I. DESCRIPTION: This policy provides direction regarding the agency purpose and the authority under which the agency performs its work. In carrying out the day-to-day operations of the agency, staff at all levels need to continually assure that decisions made and actions taken are consistent with the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program. II. DEFINITIONS: Authority: The right as expressly stated in the law, which includes statutes, rules, and regulations. Federal law, U.S. Code, Regulation, State Law, Administrative Rules and Policy, directs the agency. Employment: Competitive integrated employment, including customized employment, self- employment, telecommuting, business ownership or supported employment that is consistent with an individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. Law: Legislation that has become part of the legal code through passage by Congress and approval by the President (or via Congressional override). Purpose: Identifies the overall goal or function of an entity. This statement provides information to participants, staff, and other interested parties of the agency’s role. Regulation (Code of Federal Regulation (CFR)): Regulation is a rule or order issued by a federal or state executive-branch department or administrative agency, generally under authority granted by statute, that enforces or amplifies laws enacted by the legislature and has the force of law. State Law: State law or statute is a formal, written law of a state, written and enacted by its legislative authority, perhaps then to be ratified by the highest executive in the government and finally published. Typically, statutes command, prohibit, or declare something. Statutes are sometimes referred to as legislation. For the State of NH these are: New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) State Rules: An administrative rule is regulation or standard adopted by an agency to implement or make specific a law enforced or administered by the agency, or to interpret a procedure or practice requirement binding on persons outside the agency. Rules shall be valid and binding on persons they affect, and shall have the force of law unless amended or revised. 9 2 U.S. Code (U.S.C.): The United States Code (U.S.C.) is a compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal Law of the United States. III. POLICY: Vocational Rehabilitation New Hampshire (VRNH) assists eligible individuals with physical and mental impairments to achieve or maintain employment. The VR process is based upon an Individualized Plan for Employment. This plan is goal oriented to the achievement of a competitive integrated employment outcome. A suitable employment outcome is one which will enable an individual with a disability to secure employment that is consistent with their unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. Services provided to individuals with disabilities must be necessary to overcome the vocational impediment and must be provided in a cost-effective manner, utilizing comparable benefits whenever practicable. Reasonable accommodation will be made for all applicants to maximize each person's access to services that will enable the individual to achieve an employment outcome. A. Purpose The purpose of the New Hampshire’s Vocational Rehabilitation services program is to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that they can prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency.

It also provides information about the conditions where that information may be shared. II. PROCEDURE: A. All applicants need to be informed of the purpose for VRNH’s requesting information, whether compliance with such a request is mandatory, and the possible consequences of failing to provide information, as well as the situations in which VRNH does not need written consent to release information. B. All persons seeking services and, as appropriate, service providers and other interested persons shall be informed of the confidentiality of personal information, the procedures for its release, and the inherent risk of electronically transmitting confidential information. C. The VR-1 Application form covers information exchange between the bureau and service providers, staff should only share relevant information to provide the services appropriately. D. Persons who are unable to communicate in English or who rely on special modes of communication need to be informed of this policy on confidentiality in a manner which assures adequate understanding. Documentation that this information was provided, including method to ensure understanding, needs to be documented in the case record. E. If the VRC has concerns regarding releasing information due to a potential harm to the individual, the VRC will discuss with supervisor the information request and their professional concerns related to the release. The concern and the discussion with the supervisor, including the determination, are documented in case notes. F. If a participant requests to review and/or copy their file, a staff member must follow the procedure outlined below: 1. Prior to rendering the case file, review and remove all third party documents – this consists of any notes, evaluations, documentation, etc. that VRNH did not pay to have completed. 20 2 2. Review and assist the participant in completing a VR2-2. Be sure to highlight the risks of releasing information from our files, prior to rendering the case file. The VR2-2 should demonstrate that the participant is authorizing VRNH to release information to the participant. Within the body of the release, please specify what documents are going to be reviewed and/or copied. 3. Present the participant with a copy of this confidentiality policy and render the case file. Let the participant know that what they are reviewing is the complete case file excluding all third party documentation, as appropriate. 4. If the participant requests to review or copy the third party documentation, a staff member will have to contact the provider(s) and verify their re-release policy. If it is acceptable to re- release the documentation provided, VRNH staff may take appropriate actions based on the third party response ensuring to document the transaction. 5. At no time should a participant be left alone with their original file. A staff member needs to be in the room at all times during a case file review to ensure that the participant does not delete or alter any documents. To facilitate this process a staff member would gather information from the following from the electronic case file: a. All Activities Report (1) From the participant’s electronic case file, click on Actions at the top of the screen and select Print Reports for All Activities (2) Select PDF as the output format and click print (3) Allow the participant to view the activities within the case b. Authorization Register (1) From the participant’s electronic case file, click on Reports at the top of the screen (2) Select Authorization Register under Section 5, Financial Reports (3) Select PDF as the output format and click print (4) Allow the participant to view the authorizations if desired c. Case Note Report (1) From the participant’s electronic case file, click on Reports at the top of the screen (2) Select Case Note - All under Section 6, Case Management Reports (3) Select PDF as the output format and click print (4) Allow the participant to view the case notes if desired 6. Once the electronic file has been reviewed and the document(s) requested for copying have been identified, the staff member will print (or provide in electronic format) the documents, and give them to the participant. If the participant would like the information electronically, VRNH may provide a secure USB that contains the requested documents and provide it to the participant or it can be sent via encrypted email to the participant. 7. The staff member will create a case note to document what was requested/provided and any 21 3 background information around why the review was taking place (what the request was for, what steps were taken in response to the request, what information was given, and any other pertinent information). In addition, the staff member should ensure the VR2-2 has been attached to the electronic case file. Security of Records of Services Office Procedures. G. Personal information about applicants and eligible individuals shall not be left on desktops, on computer screens, or in any other location where it can be seen by people other than rehabilitation services staff. H. Computer lists and other electronic data and reports containing confidential information will be handled with the same security measures as required for records of services and confidential reports. I. Under no circumstances shall computer program passwords be made available to unauthorized personnel or persons. Instructions for using the computer will not be left where others might access them. J. Names of referrals, applicants and participants should not be included in the subject line of emails. K. Confidential information will be stored so that it is not accessible to anyone other than office staff. L. If any outgoing emails include PII said emails will be encrypted M. Office doors will be locked whenever office personnel are not on the premises. N. Release of personal information needs to comply with the provisions of this policy and any federal or state laws governing the source or type of information requested/released. O. In other situations where staff believe information must be released without the participant’s signed consent to protect the safety of the participant or others, the case should be discussed with the VRNH Director or the Administrator for Field services, and the decision to release made at that level. P. Staff should consult with appropriate Central Office staff concerning release of information when a subpoena is received. 22 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 305 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update None Ethics I.

Employees and their relatives, family members, or partners who become applicants for VRNH services shall be served in a different office than the one in which the employee works. 8. VR staff should be aware that a conflict of interest may exist in situations where only the appearance of impropriety exists. 24 1 305.P Ethics Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Ethics Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the ethics procedure is to ensure fair and equitable service provision to all applicants and eligible individuals of the Agency. Knowing and understanding the required ethics policies of the State of NH and VRNH is the responsibility of each member of VRNH staff. II. PROCEDURE A. Every VRNH staff member will read and become familiar with the State Ethics policy. B. VRNH staff should conduct themselves, at all times, in a manner that avoids favoritism, bias, and the appearance of impropriety. 25 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 306 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 3 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Informed Choice I. DESCRIPTION: VRNH recognizes that individuals with disabilities, their families, and representatives are partners with their vocational rehabilitation counselors in developing their vocational rehabilitation plans. The active involvement of individuals in their plans for employment contributes to the success of, and satisfaction with, the employment goal and degree of independence achieved. This policy provides direction for the VRNH program when working with applicants and eligible individuals to ensure their full participation, based on informed choice, throughout the rehabilitation process. II. DEFINITIONS: Informed Choice: A decision-making process in which the participant analyzes relevant information and selects from a range of available options, with assistance from the counselor as appropriate: the employment goal, progress measures, vocational rehabilitation services (including assessment services), and service providers. III. POLICY: The Agency must provide applicants and individuals eligible for VR services with opportunities to exercise informed choice throughout the VR process, including making decisions about the employment goal, VR services, service providers, settings for employment and service provision, and methods for procuring services. To enable an individual to make such decisions, VRNH must provide information, support, and assistance needed by the individual. A. VRNH will provide, or assist applicants and eligible individuals (or, as appropriate, their representatives) in acquiring information that enables these individuals to make meaningful and informed choices throughout the rehabilitation process. The Agency shall implement informed choice by: 1. providing information about VRNH policies that impact the individual (the counselor provides this information and guidance through modes of communication appropriate to the individual, including support services for individuals with cognitive or other disabilities who require assistance in exercising informed choice). 2. informing each applicant and eligible individual about the availability of and opportunities to exercise informed choice, including the availability of support services, 26 3 3. assisting applicants and eligible individuals in exercising informed choice in decisions related to the provision of assessment services, and 4. assisting eligible individuals or, as appropriate, the individuals' representatives, in acquiring information that enables them to exercise informed choice in the development of their individualized plan for employment with respect to the selection of the: a. employment outcome, b. specific vocational rehabilitation services needed to achieve the employment outcome, c. entities that will provide the services, d. employment setting and the sites in which the services will be provided, and e. methods available for procuring the services. B. While individuals are encouraged to actively participate, make meaningful choices, and develop all or parts of the IPE, participant choice does not mean that they have complete control over their programs. Vocational rehabilitation counselors must review, consider, and approve all IPEs. They will apply their professional judgment, applicable laws, regulations, policies, and sound planning; and be responsible in the use of public funds. C. Services must lead directly to employment goals that are feasible, timely and attainable within the fiscal constraints of the program. This means that VRNH will only support the most cost- effective option that leads to the individual's employment goal and is required to meet the individual's needs. Cost effectiveness is determined by comparing cost, level of integration, duration, quality, timeliness, proximity, and appropriateness of service options required to meet the individual's needs. D. In some cases, there may be disagreement between the individual's choice and the counselor's professional judgment that cannot be reconciled through discussion and counseling. When this occurs, the internal administrative review process should be utilized (refer to Appeals Policy). Additionally, information should be provided about the mediation process, and impartial hearing process, as well as the availability of the Client Assistance Program. Attempts to resolve the situation informally should continue. E. VRNH will assist the individual to be as independent as possible when deciding on how much assistance they need in developing the IPE and choosing among options. The case record of services will reflect how the individual was informed about, and involved in, choosing among alternative goals, objectives, service providers and methods to obtain services. The IPE will allow for optional comments by the participant. Other areas of participant involvement are documented in case notes.

I. INTRODUCTION VRNH's policy on participant involvement is intended to support participants in making informed and meaningful choices about their goals and options for achieving them, in a manner consistent with sound public policy and the use of public funds. II. PROCEDURE A. Providing Informed Choice throughout the VR Process 1. Referral Sources: Educate referral sources about participant involvement and informed choice in the VR process a. Agencies that refer people to VRNH should be informed of VRNH's policy on participant involvement as part of the ongoing process of our education of referral sources. b. Referral sources need to know that while we appreciate any information they can provide about the person's interests and preferences; the determination of what services the agency will support can only be made as part of a rehabilitation counselor developing the IPE with the participant. c. Referral sources should be made aware that VRNH considers comparable benefits, financial need, and cost-effectiveness when determining VRNH support for services. 2. Throughout the VR process: a. Inform the participant, and their representative, as applicable, about opportunities to make meaningful choices throughout the vocational rehabilitation process, including (1) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs, (2) in the selection of employment outcomes, (3) in the selection of services needed to achieve the employment outcome, (4) in selecting service providers, (5) in selecting an employment setting and the setting in which the services will be provided, and (6) in selecting the methods used to procure services. b. Discover most effective modes of communication for the individual so they participate actively in exercising informed choice. 28 2 c. Understand that for individuals who have not had experience in making decisions for themselves, or individuals with significant impairments in communication skills, they may require support and assistance to exercise informed choice. 3. Orientation and Intake: During initial meetings with participants, VRNH staff should emphasize: a. The importance of participant involvement in the entire VR process, especially in the development and selection of vocational goals and services or sources that lead to those goals, b. That VRNH's role is to help people go to work and that the services we support must relate to that outcome. 4. IPE Development: The counselor should work to ensure participant involvement in the development of the IPE, including providing opportunities for informed choice. a. In developing the IPE, provide the participant, or assist them in acquiring, information necessary to make an informed choice about the specific vocational rehabilitation services needed to achieve the employment outcome and the providers of those services. This information includes: (1) Cost, accessibility, and duration of potential services; (2) Consumer satisfaction with those services, to the extent that this information is available; (3) Qualifications of potential service providers; (4) Types of services offered by the potential providers; and (5) Outcomes achieved by individuals working with service providers, to the extent that this information is available. b. Sources of information concerning services and service providers that may be used include, but are not limited to: (1) Lists of services and service providers; (2) Periodic customer satisfaction surveys and reports; (3) Referrals to other participants, consumer groups, or disability advisory councils qualified to discuss the services or service providers; (4) Relevant accreditation, certification or other information related to the qualifications of service providers; and (5) Opportunities for the individual to visit or experience various work and service provider settings. c. Advise participant early in the process that VRNH is not necessarily the sole source of support in achieving those goals, and that agreement to a goal does not imply VRNH financing of all related services. Financial need, comparable benefits, and cost-effectiveness may limit VRNH's financial contribution in some instances. By involving the individual in the discussion of options and available resources 29 3 throughout the counseling process, VRNH can help participants select cost-effective options that will meet their goals. The participant may prefer a program that is more costly (due to basic program costs or the additional supports it may entail), but VRNH's financial support will be limited to the most cost-effective option, that is, the least costly alternative that provides the supports and services essential for the person to achieve the agreed upon vocational goal. The most cost- effective program may not always be the least expensive; it could be a more expensive program with significantly better placement outcomes. Examples of cost-effective programs are as follows: (1) The individual has a vocational goal that can be achieved through either a business and trade school or a community college. The community college program is less expensive and has a comparable or better placement record. If the individual opts to attend the business school, VRNH will limit its tuition support to the amount that would have been paid to attend the community college. (2) The individual’s training can be met equally well by two programs, one that includes needed support services and one that would require support services to be arranged separately at extra cost. If all other factors are approximately equal, and if the individual elects to attend the more costly program, VRNH's financial support would be limited to the cost of the program that includes support services. In some cases, it may be less costly to provide room and transportation to an out-of-state program that provides support services, such as interpreters, rather than have someone attend a local program that has no support services. 5. Document participant participation and informed choice in the vocational rehabilitation process. a. The options discussed by the participant and counselor, including a comparison of the factors that were considered in determining cost-effectiveness and the reasons for selecting a particular option, should be documented in case notes. This includes but is not limited to: (1) Information about discussions of options and available resources throughout the counseling process, (2) How the individual was informed about and involved in choosing among alternative goals, objectives, service providers, and methods to obtain service, and (3) How the individual was informed of their options for developing their IPE. b. If the counselor and participant cannot achieve consensus, the record should indicate the reasons for their respective opinions and that the participant was advised of the appeals process. 30 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 307 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Case Records I.

DESCRIPTION: Provides policy for the use of fees and expenditures in the provision of services. II. DEFINITIONS: Maintenance: Monetary support provided to an individual for expenses, such as food, shelter, and clothing, that are in excess of the normal expenses of the individual and that are necessitated by the individual’s participation in an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs or the individual’s receipt of vocational rehabilitation services under an individualized plan for employment. Pre-employment transition services: The required activities and authorized activities specified in 34 CFR 361.48(a)(2) and (3). III. POLICY: Goods and services shall be purchased based on the individual services necessary to complete an assessment for the determination of eligibility, or as specified in an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) in accordance with the Bureau’s Medical Fee Schedule, Community Rehabilitation Provider Fee Schedule, and Operational Manual. Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS), or Auxiliary Aids and services necessary for the provision of Pre-ETS, may be purchased for potentially eligible individuals prior to application as well. Payments made must be reasonable and necessary for the individual’s success. A. Case service expenditures require written authorization documented in the case management system prior to the initiation of the service or the purchase of any good. Oral authorizations are permitted in emergency situations, but must be promptly confirmed in writing and forwarded to the provider. B. Counselors will refer individuals to other agencies and organizations to secure necessary services if such services are not available under the Rehabilitation Act as Amended or in those instances where a comparable benefit is available from other agencies or organizations. C. Prior to purchasing services not specifically exempt in the ‘Financial Participation in Cost’ policy, the individual’s and/or their immediate family’s ability to contribute financially to the provision of services shall be demonstrated through a financial needs assessment in accordance with NH Department of Education rules. The financial needs assessment shall be used for determining the extent of the individual’s participation in the costs of vocational 34 rehabilitation services, and a strategy for this participation will be agreed upon prior to the expenditure of funds. D. If an individual has been found financially eligible within the past year by a means test from another public benefit program by any state or federal agency, it shall be assumed that financial need exists under the VR program. Written evidence of this eligibility is required from those authorities. Examples would include, but are not be limited to, a verification of receipt of SSI or a written notice of financial eligibility from the NH Department of Health and Human Services. E. Purchase/Reimbursement Restrictions: VRNH is restricted from purchasing, or reimbursing others for the purchase of, the following goods and services under any circumstances: 1. vehicles licensed to operate on public thoroughfares, 2. the purchase of land or buildings, or 3. goods and services contradictory to State or Federal Law, such as a. marijuana in any form, or related equipment, or b. payments directly made to an employer in the marijuana industry F. In the event that VRNH is restricted from purchasing, and/or reimbursing for, a good/service, the Counselor may assist the participant in finding other avenues to obtain the good/service when it is considered necessary and appropriate to reach the employment objective. G. Payment for services: Reports from the vendor must be received identifying the nature of the service, dates of services, costs and, when appropriate, the impact of service before payment will be rendered. H. Direct payments to a program participant: VRNH may make direct payments to a program participant for Transportation, Reimbursement, Advance Payment, or a payment to a Financial Advocate. VRNH will only reimburse or advance pay participants for subscriptions, technological applications (apps), maintenance (rent, utilities, etc.), exams, and license fees when payment is required at application for the license, or at the discretion of the VR Supervisor for other unique circumstances. Direct payments are not intended to circumvent the Bureau’s purchasing requirements, or to allow a vendor to be a service provider in the State while not in good standing. Participants should not make purchases with the intent of being reimbursed prior to agreement with the counselor. 1. Customer Transportation – VRNH may provide funds to a participant for projected travel in association with a training program, employment, or job search. This is authorized on a monthly basis. Backup documentation includes either a travel calculator or a quote from a taxi or bus company the participant will use. 2.

Statements and transactions must be able to be verified to the participant by means of account holder name or account number through additional documentation if necessary. The bureau will not reimburse for any purchase made using a gift card, store credit, or other similar method for which ownership is not verifiable. 3. Advance Payment – VRNH may pay a customer for an anticipated expense if agreed upon by the participant and counselor, and the service or product is reflected in the plan for employment. This option should only be used as a last resort, and all other options must have been explored. Backup documentation includes a quote for the item or service that will be purchased. Quotes are required for items or services over $100.00 unless sole source justification is provided. In addition, a case note must accompany the authorization explaining the exploration of other payment options. 4. Financial Advocate – VRNH may reimburse a participant’s financial advocate for an expenditure they made on behalf of the participant if agreed upon by the participant and counselor, and the service or product is reflected in the plan for employment. Backup documentation includes a written statement from the financial advocate explaining who they are and why they made the purchase on behalf of the participant, in addition to one of the following: cash receipt, bank statement or transaction log, or a credit card statement in the financial advocate’s name showing the purchase. Statements and transactions must be able to be verified to the financial advocate by means of account holder name or account number through additional documentation if necessary.

I. Choosing a Provider: 1. The participant in need of a service may choose the provider unless: a. the provider’s fee substantially exceeds that of others in the field or the provider refuses the fees established in a VRNH Fee Schedule, b. the provider refused to accept payment from VRNH or from a comparable benefit source, or c. travel and related costs to the agency to get to/from the provider of choice substantially exceed the costs to get to a closer provider (unless another source bears the costs). 2. If a participant chooses a provider whose fee substantially exceeds fees of others, VRNH may provide the lesser amount if the participant or another source provides the 36 4 difference. 3. If they are based in New Hampshire, the service provider must be in good standing with the State of New Hampshire, and all service providers must not be excluded from doing business with the United States Government. 4. Prior to selecting a new vendor, the vendor must be approved by at least the VR Supervisor and potentially the Director or Field Service Administrator per VRNH procedure. 37 6 308.P Fees and Expenditures Procedure Revision date: 4/1/2022 See corresponding policy: Fees and Expenditures Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. INTRODUCTION VRNH's policy on fees and expenditures provides a framework for expenditures and the use of public funds. II. PROCEDURE: Link to operational manual online at: (note: need to be connected to state network to use this link: http://hzndoevrpts1p/intranet/vrIntranet/docs/Operational_Manual.pdf A. All services must be pre-authorized. The only exception is if it is an emergency; i.e., a serious, unexpected, and potentially dangerous situation requiring immediate action. Examples might include situations where, without that service the individual will be seriously injured or will lose their employment and an authorization cannot be generated immediately. 1. Oral authorization should be documented in case notes and include what service was authorized, how many units, the time frame of authorization, and what the emergency situation was. 2. When creating the written authorization, a comment should be added to the authorization documenting that the service was previously authorized orally. B. Payment for Services: All invoices are reviewed and approved by counselors or VR Supervisors prior to payment. Such approval can either be electronic through the case management system or by initialing the physical invoice. In addition, the counselor or VR Supervisor should ensure proper documentation (e.g. report) has been received from the vendor to ensure satisfactory services have been provided. C. Payment for goods: Prior to processing a payment for a good, a staff member must receive written confirmation of receipt from the participant, signed by the participant, email from the participant acknowledging receipt, or a Receiving and Inspection Report (R&I) signed by the participant. Should payment need to be processed prior to a participant receiving the item (i.e., payment using an Agency Procurement Card), or if the office is unable to acquire the required participant documentation, a case note related to the payment from the Rehabilitation Counselor III or VR Supervisor is needed. The case note documents the reason 38 6 why the participant has not received the item at the time of payment or why the office was unable to acquire documentation verifying receipt. If documentation was not received, the case note must contain the reason why, attempts made to obtain the documentation, the date in which the items were received, and who the staff member communicated with confirming receipt or why the office was unable to acquire documentation verifying receipt. If documentation was not received, the case note must contain the reason why, attempts made to obtain the documentation, the date in which the items were received, and who the staff member communicated with confirming receipt. D. Direct payments to a program participant: VR will only reimburse or advance pay participants for subscriptions, technological applications (apps), maintenance (rent, utilities, etc.), license and license fees when payment is required at application for the license, or other unique circumstances with the approval of the VR Supervisor. VR Supervisors should ensure all other options to acquire the good or service have been explored prior to authorization for the good or service not listed above.

DESCRIPTION: An applicant or eligible individual for VRNH services who is dissatisfied with any determination made by VRNH concerning the provision of services may seek to resolve that dissatisfaction through Mediation and/or Impartial Hearing. The objective of mediation is to reach a mutually agreeable solution, as quickly as possible, preferably before a formal Impartial Hearing. VRNH will assist individuals to be active participants in their program and advise them of their rights, the steps of the Administrative Review, Mediation and Impartial Hearing processes and the availability of assistance from the Client Assistance Program (CAP) when: A. an application is made, B. an ineligibility decision is made, C. an individualized plan for employment (IPE) is developed, D. a potential impasse is reached or services are reduced, suspended or terminated, E. a case is closed, or F. the assignment of an individual to a priority category, if order of selection is in effect. II. DEFINITIONS: Fair Hearing: A formal procedure whereby an individual who is dissatisfied with any determinations concerning the provision or denial of Vocational Rehabilitation services may seek a re-determination of the action before an impartial hearing officer. Good Cause: Adequate or substantial grounds or reason to take a certain action. Impartial hearing officer/mediator: An individual, trained with respect to due process and the performance of official duties as a hearing officer or, for mediators, trained in effective mediation techniques, who A. is not an employee of a public Agency (other than an administrative law judge, hearing examiner, or employee of an institution of higher education), B. is not a member of the State Rehabilitation Committee (SRC), C. has not been involved previously in the vocational rehabilitation of the applicant or eligible individual, D. has knowledge of the delivery of VR services, the State plan, and the Federal and State regulations governing the provision of services, and 40 2 E. has no personal, professional, or financial interest that would be in conflict with the objectivity of the individual. Mediation: A formal process of using an independent third party to act as an intermediary, mediator, or conciliator to assist in settling disputes prior to pursuing formal administrative or other legal remedies. III. POLICY: A. General Provisions 1. An applicant or eligible individual, or their representative, shall be informed throughout the vocational rehabilitation process of the following: (notification must be made when the individual applies for services, a determination regarding eligibility is made, at the time of Plan development and whenever a change is made to the IPE). a. their right to mediation and/or Fair Hearing, b. the procedure for requesting a review and re-determination of Agency action concerning the furnishing or denial of services, including the names and addresses of individuals with whom appeals may be filed and an explanation of their intended purpose, and c. the Client Assistance Program and how to contact them. 2. VRNH shall make reasonable accommodation to the individual's disability in the conduct of the appeals process. 3. Continuation of Services: Pending a final determination of a Fair Hearing, or Admin Review procedures, VRNH may not suspend, reduce, or terminate services being provided under an IPE or assessment services, unless the services were obtained through misrepresentation, fraud or collusion, or criminal conduct of the individual, or if the individual or their authorized representative, requests suspension, reduction, or termination of services. Exception: When discontinuation of the service is the result of a third party provider’s decision over which the Agency has no control. When the service is discontinued as a result of a third-party decision, the Agency shall make every effort to assess the circumstances with the affected individual and make an appropriate and expedited amendment to the IPE. B. Administrative Review 1. An applicant for, or recipient of, vocational rehabilitation services who is dissatisfied with any determination made by the Agency concerning the furnishing or denial of services may request a timely review of the determination. 41 3 2. VRNH will attempt to resolve conflicts informally at the lowest possible level between the participant and Agency staff. When requested, administrative reviews will follow the following process, unless a resolution is achieved: a. review by the assigned Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC), b. review by the supervising Regional Leader, and c. finally review by the Director or their designee. C. Fair Hearing 1. The individual must request a Fair Hearing within thirty (30) days after notification of the final decision of the Director or designee. 2. The request for a Fair Hearing shall be in writing and shall describe the complaint. In those instances where a written request is a burden to the individual, oral requests or requests through a third party will be entertained. 3. The Fair Hearing shall be conducted within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties. 4. A Fair Hearing will be conducted by an impartial hearing officer selected at random from a pool of qualified persons identified jointly by the Director of the Agency and the State Rehabilitation Council. 5. VRNH may not deny or dismiss a request for Fair Hearing unless the individual or his/her representative a. withdraws the request in writing; or b. is adjudged by the Fair Hearing officer to be in default for failure to appear at the hearing without good cause. 6. The Fair Hearing shall be conducted and a recommended decision shall be issued in accordance with the New Hampshire Administrative Procedures Act. (RSA 541-A). 7. The decision, or part of the decision, of the impartial hearing officer, that supports the applicant or eligible individual can only be overturned or modified by the reviewing official, based on clear and convincing evidence that the decision of the impartial hearing officer is clearly erroneous, since it is contrary to the approved State Plan, the Act, Federal Regulations, or any state regulation or policy that is consistent with federal requirements. 8. The Fair Hearing decision shall be considered final by the Agency pending the outcome of further civil action. Either party may file a civil action challenging the impartial hearing officer's decision. The civil action may be filed in state court or in federal district court. Should a civil action be filed, records relating to the hearing will be provided to the court, which can hear additional evidence at the request of either party, and render a decision, based on the preponderance of evidence, and grant appropriate relief. 42 4 D. Mediation 1. The individual may request mediation within thirty (30) days after notification of the final decision of the Director or designee. 2. The request for a mediation shall be in writing and shall describe the complaint. In those instances where a written request is a burden to the individual, oral requests or requests through a third party will be entertained. 3. The mediation shall be conducted within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties. 4. Mediation will be conducted by an impartial mediator selected at random from a pool of qualified persons identified jointly by the Director of the Agency and the State Rehabilitation Council. 5. Mediation services will be arranged at a time that is convenient to the applicant for, or recipient of, vocational rehabilitation services and a designated Vocational Rehabilitation staff person. 6. At the initial meeting with a mediator, the applicant for, or recipient of, vocational rehabilitation services and the VR staff person will agree on the issue to be decided, the process, and the time period during which mediation will occur. 7. Applicants for, or recipients of, vocational rehabilitation services who choose mediation remain eligible for a fair hearing before an impartial hearing officer within 60 days from the point of filing a request for the hearing. 43 1 309.P Appeals Procedure Revision date: Original 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Appeals Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the appeals procedure is to assure that all applicants and participants of VRNH receive information regarding their rights to appeal, and upon appeal receive consistent application of review processes. The policy and procedure is designed to assist individuals who are dissatisfied with any determination made by VRNH staff concerning the provision of services. It provides them opportunity to seek and receive a timely review of the decision and resolution of any disagreement. Throughout the due process, staff should continue to attempt to reach resolution with the individual in the most collaborative and least confrontational manner possible. II. PROCEDURE: A. The Agency encourages participants and staff to attempt to resolve issues on an informal basis. B. Staff and participants should consult with the appropriate supervisor, or central office representative when there is an unresolved disagreement about the provision of services or other program issue. C. Even though the Agency should try to resolve disputes as informally as possible, mediation and administrative hearings are a legal right available to participants. It is therefore imperative that participants be informed of the availability of these redress procedures and the timeframes that they must follow to exercise their rights. D. Ensure awareness of Appeals opportunities 1. The Client Assistance Program (CAP) brochure will be displayed in each office's reception areas. 2. Individuals will be informed about the availability of due process at application during the initial interview process. 44 2 E. When requests for review are received, staff must try to resolve participant dissatisfaction in the most expeditious and simple manner possible, while adhering to federal and state law and VRNH policy. By endeavoring to resolve dissatisfaction in the simplest manner possible, including discussion with the counselor's supervisor, staff help assure that issues do not evolve into more confrontational situations. 45 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 310 Revision # 2 Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 12 Last Reviewed/Update Date 7/1/2024 Policy: Order of Selection I. DESCRIPTION: The Rehabilitation Act requires that if Vocational Rehabilitation New Hampshire (VRNH) cannot serve all eligible individuals who apply for services, a process (Order of Selection) must be developed to establish the order in which individuals with disabilities will be provided services. The Order of Selection Policy is in effect but not put into operation unless Order of Selection is declared. This policy outlines the equitable means VRNH has established to determine how eligible individuals will be selected to receive services if there is an Order of Selection in place. As mandated by law, individuals with the most significant disability must be served first. VRNH is not currently in an Order of Selection. VRNH will base the determination of who may receive services only on the significance of an individual’s disability and by the date of application for VRNH services. Order of Selection in no way affects the eligibility process. Eligibility determination follows all existing policy and procedure. II. DEFINITIONS: Individual with a significant disability: An individual with a disability— a. Who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacities (such as mobility, communication, self-care, self-direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance, or work skills) in terms of an employment outcome; b. Whose vocational rehabilitation can be expected to require multiple vocational rehabilitation services over an extended period of time; and c. Who has one or more physical or mental disabilities resulting from amputation, arthritis, autism, blindness, burn injury, cancer, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, deafness, head injury, heart disease, hemiplegia, hemophilia, respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, musculo-skeletal disorders, neurological disorders (including stroke and epilepsy), spinal cord conditions (including paraplegia and quadriplegia), sickle cell anemia, intellectual disability, specific learning disability, end-stage renal disease, or another disability or combination of disabilities determined on the basis of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs to cause comparable substantial functional limitation. 46 1 Individual with a most significant disability: An individual with a significant disability: 1. Who has a significant mental or physical impairment that seriously limits 3 or more functional capacities such as mobility, motor skills, communication, self-care, self- direction, interpersonal skills, and work tolerance or work skills in terms of employment goals; and 2. Whose vocational rehabilitation is expected to require 3 or more vocational rehabilitation services over a period of 6 months or longer; Individual with a less significant disability: An individual with a disability who does not meet the definition of an individual with a most significant or significant disability. Post-Employment services: One or more of the services identified in 34 CFR 361.48(b) that are provided subsequent to the achievement of an employment outcome and that are necessary for an individual to maintain, regain, or advance in employment, consistent with the individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. Pre-employment transition services: The required activities and authorized activities specified in 34 CFR 361.48(a)(2) and (3). Policy Note: VRNH is not currently in an Order of Selection. Should there be a time when the bureau determines that vocational rehabilitation services cannot be provided to all eligible individuals in the state who apply, VRNH will redetermine the need to enter an Order of Selection. The policy in this section would go into effect at that time. III. POLICY: VRNH will enter an Order of Selection (OOS) when one of two criteria are met: 1) the agency does not have adequate staff to provide all customers service, or 2) the agency does not have the financial resources to provide services to all current customers and new customers. Should VRNH enter an OOS, the order assures that individuals with the most significant disabilities will be served first. (reference Disability Priority policy) A. Ability to serve all eligible individuals and OOS for services. VRNH will make every effort to utilize resources to provide a full range of services to all eligible individuals in the State who apply for VR services. In the event that vocational rehabilitation services cannot be provided to all eligible individuals in New Hampshire who apply for the services, the Agency will adopt an OOS. The order to be followed in selecting eligible individuals to be provided vocational rehabilitation services is defined in policy and in the vocational rehabilitation services portion of the State’s Combined State Plan. B. Prohibited Factors. The following factors cannot be used in determining OOS of eligible individuals: 1. Any duration of residency requirement, provided the individual is present in the State, 2. Type of disability, 47 1 3. Age, gender, race, creed, color, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or political affiliation, 4. Source of referral, 5. Type of expected employment outcome, 6. The need for specific services or anticipated cost of services required by an individual, or 7. The income level of an individual or an individual’s family. C. Specific Administrative Requirements. In administering an OOS in the State, the Agency will 1. implement the OOS on a Statewide basis, 2. assure that all applicants are to receive whatever diagnostic services are necessary for the determination of eligibility and significance of disability without regard to the OOS, 3. in determining the Priority Category, ensure persons are placed in the highest category for which they meet the OOS priority category criteria, 4. assure all eligible persons shall, after determination of eligibility, be classified by Priority Category I, II, or III. (The OOS will have no effect upon the eligibility determination for the individual, only upon the order in which such person may receive vocational rehabilitation services.), 5. notify all eligible individuals of the priority categories in a State’s OOS, their assignment to a particular category, and their right to appeal their category assignment, 6. continue to provide services to any participant who has begun to receive services irrespective of the severity of the individual’s disability as follows— a. the Agency will continue to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities who were receiving such services prior to being determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation services, and b. the Agency must continue to provide to an eligible individual all needed services listed on the individualized plan for employment if the individual had begun receiving such services prior to the effective date of the State’s OOS, 7. continue to provide services to participants at immediate risk of losing their current job regardless if they are in an open or closed priority group, and 8. update an individual’s priority category, as appropriate. a. If an individual submits additional documentation that supports movement from a less significant to a more significant priority category, the information will be reviewed and VRNH will determine if the individual should be reclassified and moved to a more significant priority category (e.g., an individual was presumed to be eligible and have a significant disability based on an SSA award letter; however, additional medical documentation was later submitted to substantiate that the individual was an individual with a most significant disability). b. Although a person's circumstances may change so that they are no longer eligible for a particular Priority Category, the person will remain in that category unless the change favors them. This will not apply to 48 misclassification; a misclassified person, if moved to a less favorable Priority Category, will be advised of the change in writing and provided with appeal rights and information on the Client Assistance Program. D. State Rehabilitation Council 1. The Agency will consult with the State Rehabilitation Council regarding the— a. need to establish an OOS, including any reevaluation of the need, b. priority categories of the particular OOS, c. criteria for determining individuals with the most significant disabilities, and d. administration of the OOS. 2. A full review of the OOS, with input from the State Rehabilitation Council, shall take place at least annually. E. Priority Categories. The Rehabilitation Act places emphasis on VR services for persons with the most significant disabilities and assigns priority to meeting the needs of that group. This requirement is to assure that, in event that VR services cannot be provided to all eligible persons in the State, the needs of those with the most significant disabilities will be given priority. When the VRNH Agency determines that services cannot be provided to all eligible individuals who apply, an OOS will be implemented as follows: 1. Priority One: Most Significant Disability(MSD) 2. Priority Two: Significant Disability (SD) 3. Priority Three: Less Significant Disability(L-SD) F. VRNH Statewide Wait List for OOS 1. VRNH may operate under a Statewide Wait List when resources (e.g. fiscal, personnel) are inadequate to meet the service needs of all individuals in the current or next fiscal year. 2. An individual is placed on the VR OOS Wait List based on assignment of their priority category under OOS and then date of application. 3. Students who have begun to receive pre-employment transition services prior to eligibility determination and placement in a closed priority category will continue to receive any and all pre-employment transition services while assigned to a wait list. However, individualized VR services only available under an individualized plan for employment (IPE) will not be available to students on a wait list, until they are removed from the wait list and have an approved IPE. 4. Individuals, who have begun to receive services under an IPE, prior to the effective date of the Statewide Wait List, shall continue to receive services regardless of the priority category assigned under OOS. 5. Individuals who are placed on the Statewide Wait List shall be provided information about and referral to other local programs. 6. If an individual’s priority category under OOS is amended and they are still on 49 the Statewide Wait List, their placement shall be reprioritized by date of application. G. Determination to Serve 1. VRNH reserves the right to determine how many Priority Categories shall receive vocational rehabilitation services at any given time. 2. When sufficient funds are available to serve additional or all individuals who apply for and are determined eligible for services, categories within the OOS will be opened in order (1 (MSD), 2 (SD), 3(L-SD)). Management determines the effective date to open categories. 3. Whenever it is determined that VRNH resources for services are available for eligible persons in a closed Priority Category, such eligible persons shall receive services in the order in which they applied for VRNH services. VRNH reserves the right to determine how many eligible persons within a closed Priority Category may receive services at any given time. This number will be determined by reviewing available resources and anticipated costs. As many persons will be served as resources allow. 4. VRNH shall release individuals from the Statewide Wait List in the following order: a. By their priority category under OOS, and b. By their application date. 5. All individuals will be served in a priority category, and the wait list will be cleared, before the next priority category will be opened, starting with the most significant priority category. H. Statewide Wait List Termination The Statewide Wait List shall end when the Director, or designee, determines that adequate resources (i.e., fiscal and/or human resources) are available to provide services to all individuals who meet the eligibility criteria. I. Implementing an OOS 1. The agency must provide a full range of vocational rehabilitation services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals who apply. In the event that these services cannot be provided to all eligible individuals in the State, the agency must implement an OOS. Vocational rehabilitation services shall be provided based upon availability of funds. Vocational Rehabilitation New Hampshire (VRNH) implemented an OOS with its VR program effective May 2018. 2. All applicants are to receive the diagnostic services that are necessary for the determination of eligibility and significance of disability without regard to the OOS. 3. In determining the Priority Category, persons are to be placed in the highest category for which they are eligible. 50 J. OOS Categories 1. After determination of eligibility, all eligible persons shall be classified by Priority Category. The OOS will have no effect upon the eligibility of the person but only upon the order in which such persons may receive vocational rehabilitation services. 2. Individuals applying for or receiving services shall be placed in priority categories. Depending upon Agency resources, the categories shall be closed for services in ascending order beginning with Category 3 (L-SD) and proceeding to Categories 2 (SD) and 1 (MSD). Services shall be provided only to those individuals in an open category. All individuals who were in an Individualized plan for employment when the order was implemented will continue to receive services without an interruption in their plan. 3. Under the OOS, the agency will continue to emphasize and provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities who began such services prior to eligibility determination to ensure a smooth transition from school to work. 4. VRNH staff will be advised via formal issuance when categories are closed or reopened. K. Notification of the Individual of Priority Status 1. The counselor will notify all eligible individuals, in writing, at the time of eligibility determination of a. the priority categories in the OOS b. their assignment to a particular category and, if applicable, placement on a statewide wait list. c. The notification shall be their appeal rights and the availability of services from a Client Assistance Program (CAP). d. their right to appeal their assignment to a particular category. (1) Any eligible person may request mediation or fair hearing to appeal his/her classification by Priority Category. This request must be made within thirty (30) days after notification of classification by Priority Category. (2) If a request for mediation fair hearing is made, priority classification shall not be changed pending completion of the appeals process. L. Delayed Status (Wait List) 1. An individual’s priority in the OOS will be determined at the time of eligibility based on the individual’s current situation and not based on projected job goals, specific services needed, or limitations the individual might have in the future. A participant can subsequently be moved to a higher priority group if information becomes available indicating additional or more severe functional limitations. 2. Any eligible individual not being served due to OOS will be placed on a wait list. A statewide list will be maintained for each of the significance of disability categories. The order in which an individual is placed on the wait list is based on the date of application. The wait list is overseen from VRNH’s Administrative Office. As resources become available, individuals on the wait list will be 51 notified when services can be provided. a. All eligible individuals must be notified of the priority categories used by VRNH in an OOS, what significance of disability category they have been assigned to, and their right to appeal their category assignment. b. Eligible individuals who cannot presently be served under the Priority of Services/OOS will be advised that their case will be placed on a wait list. c. For all individuals placed on a wait list, VRNH will provide information and referral regarding job-related services. This may include referring individuals with disabilities to other appropriate federal and state programs, including other components of the statewide workforce system. VRNH staff must give individuals a specific point of contact within the agency to which the individual is being referred, as well as information and advice regarding the most suitable services. The provider to whom a referral is made is to receive a letter of notice regarding a referral being made. M. Service Provision in Delayed Status. While an individual is on the wait list, no vocational rehabilitation services will be provided except as provided below. Provision of these services in delayed status shall be documented in case notes. 1. Information and Referral should be provided to individuals being placed on the wait list. Consideration should be given to referral to a community college, especially if the individual can access a tuition waiver, to Centers for Independent Living, and to American Job Centers as well as other local resources, as appropriate. 2. Referral for Job Placement may be provided to no-cost (comparable benefit) providers (e.g., the local American Job Center), as indicated in the Eligible- Delayed letters. 3. Pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities who were receiving such services prior to being determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation services. 4. Exemption to the provision of services for individuals who are in immediate danger of job loss. N. Updating the Priority Category under OOS 1. If new information is received by VR Staff at any point during an eligible individual’s case, it shall be evaluated and if applicable, the Agency shall determine if the original priority category under OOS should be amended. 2. Although a person's circumstances may change so that they are no longer eligible for a particular Priority Category, the person will remain in that category unless the change favors them. This will not apply to misclassification; a misclassified person, if moved to a less favorable Priority Category, will be advised of the change in writing and provided with appeal rights and information on the Client Assistance Program. O. Notification of Eligible Individuals 1. Notification of Reassignment in a Priority Category and Appeal Rights: a. All persons eligible for VRNH services shall be classified by Priority Category at the 52 time of their certification of eligibility or as soon thereafter as possible. b. Individuals shall be appropriately notified, in writing, at the time of assignment or reassignment to a priority category under OOS and, if applicable, placement on a statewide wait list. c. Included in the notification shall be their appeal rights and the availability of services from a Client Assistance Program (CAP). d. Any eligible person may request mediation or fair hearing to appeal his/her classification by Priority Category. This request must be made within thirty (30) days after notification of classification by Priority Category. e. If a request for mediation or fair hearing is made, priority classification shall not be changed pending completion of the appeals process. 2. Ongoing Contact: Contact letters will be sent to individuals on the wait list (deferred status) at least every 180 days (at least every 90 days to category 1). These letters will ask the participant to contact the responsible VR counselor to express continued interest in VR services and to provide information about any changes in their disability status. Lack of response to two such contact letters may be cause to initiate normal closure procedures. P. Initiating Services for Individuals Referred from the OOS Wait List 1. When funding is not sufficient to serve all eligible individuals, those in Priority Group One (MSD) will be served first, those in Priority Group Two (SD) second, and those in Priority Group Three (L-SD) served last. Should a participant be assigned to a closed priority group, the participant will be given the opportunity to be placed on a wait list until resources are available to remove participants from the wait list to receive services. 2. The Director, or designee will determine when it is appropriate to implement procedures to reestablish or maintain contact with individuals while they are on the OOS wait list. Factors to consider are the length of time an individual has been on the list and the anticipated time before the individual’s category will open. 3. Upon receipt of a case transferred from the OOS wait list, the VR counselor takes steps to contact the individual within five working days. Telephone contact is acceptable; however, if efforts to contact the individual by telephone are not successful within 2 days, a letter must be sent by the third day, scheduling the individual for an appointment. The appointment is scheduled no later than 10 working days from the date the letter is sent. a. Counselors need to consider the communication needs of the individual, including the need for information in alternate formats when initiating contact by telephone or letter. b. If an individual missed a scheduled appointment or does not respond to an initial letter by the specified date, a certified letter is sent within 3 working days explaining that if the individual does not contact VRNH within 10 days to initiate services, the case service record will be closed. The letter will include information explaining the current status of the wait list and instructions on how to reapply at a later time. c. Reasonable and timely efforts will also be made to verify or find updated 53 telephone numbers and addresses, to contact the referral source, and/or to contact person(s) identified on the application or otherwise in the case service record. d. If the date identified in the closure notification letter passes and there is no response from the individual and efforts to locate the individual through other sources have not resulted in contact, the case will be closed. e. Steps to contact each individual are documented in the case management system narrative and filed in the case service record. Q. Individuals not ready to Proceed with IPE Development upon Referral from the OOS Wait list 1. If a VR counselor contacts an individual to initiate services and he/she is not ready to begin working with VR, the VR counselor needs to help the individual make an informed decision about how to proceed. VRNH cannot ‘hold’ a spot on the wait list nor can an individual be put back at the top of the list. The VR counselor needs to discuss the reasons the individual is not ready to proceed and whether a reasonable time frame can be agreed upon to resolve the issues. The VR counselor and individual will make plans to proceed with vocational planning and IPE development within a reasonable time period or to close the case. In some cases, closing the case and submitting a new application at later date may be the most appropriate option. R. Information and Referral (I&R) 1. VRNH must provide information and referral to community resources and partners in the statewide workforce system. Referrals may also be made to Independent Living Centers, mental health counseling facilities, counseling services, Employment Networks (EN), college and university career centers, and services for students with disabilities offices. VR needs to provide information and guidance when referring to the most suitable services to assist the individual with their employment needs and a specific contact point, as appropriate. a. When operating under OOS, VRNH is required to offer a formal, discreet Information and Referral (I&R) service to individuals who cannot be served and must wait for services because of the OOS. b. VRNH must document and retain information about referrals to other federal and state programs that provide employment-related services. Information and referral services will be documented in case notes. S. Information and Referral Requirements 1. Federal regulations establish minimum requirements under information and referral (I&R) as follows. VRNH must: a. provide individuals with accurate vocational rehabilitation information and guidance (which may include counseling and referral for job placement) to prepare 54 for, get, or keep a job, and b. refer individuals with disabilities to other federal or state programs that are best suited to address their specific employment needs, including partners in the workforce system. T. Counseling and Guidance 1. To provide individuals with accurate VR information and guidance, which may include counseling and referral for job placement, a VR counseling staff member will talk to the individual about their need to prepare for, get or keep a job. The VR counseling staff member will provide advice and guidance about how the individual might proceed, explains referral sources available, and offers to initiate a referral to another program, if appropriate. These interactions occur in the course of other activities, such as completing the application, intake, and eligibility determination. 2. For individuals who choose not to apply for VRNH services because of the OOS, a general guideline is to limit I & R services to one appointment. The VR counselor will NOT establish an on-going counseling relationship nor perform follow-up services regarding I&R. U. Counseling and Guidance – Referrals 1. Each office will maintain a list of federal and state programs with which VRNH has established a formal referral relationship. It is expected that the NH One-Stop Centers will be used extensively, but not exclusively, for the referral of individuals who either choose not to apply for or are on a wait list to receive VRNH services. Because of limited resources in some areas and the unique needs of some individuals with disabilities, there will not be an appropriate program available to every person. 2. VR counseling staff may provide referral for job placement. If the individual intends to engage in independent, self- directed job search or related activities, the VR counseling staff member may provide a referral to another agency, such as NHWORKS partners, to assist the individual in this effort. V. Documenting a Referral 1. All referrals to employment-related programs must be documented, including referrals for individuals who have applied and are waiting for services, and referrals for individuals who choose not to apply for services because of the OOS. Each VR Supervisor, or designee, will identify and maintain the list of regional referral sources that require a referral. Each time an individual is referred to one of the listed organizations, the VR counseling staff member needs to document the referral in the case notes along with copies of any written referrals. Every case will identify that appropriate referrals were made prior to transferring the case to the OOS wait list, or the case service record will document efforts to locate referral sources and the reason(s) a referral was not provided. 2. If an individual requests a referral, the VR counseling staff member will prepare and 55 send a written referral to the organization. In addition, the VR counseling staff member will provide the individual being referred with the following: a. a copy of the written referral notifying the other Federal or State program about the referral, b. the name of the person in that organization to be contacted by the individual being referred, and c. information about the most suitable services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment. W. Pre-employment Transition Services 1. Students who are considered “potentially eligible” for VR services will receive pre- employment transition services regardless of the OOS. 2. Students with disabilities who apply for VR services and who began receiving pre- employment transition services prior to applying for and being determined eligible will continue to have access to pre-employment transition services even if their priority group is closed. 3. Any student with a disability that has applied for VR services who is not yet participating in pre-employment transition services when the eligibility determination is made, and who is placed in a closed priority group, will be served, when funding is sufficient, in the order of application date. VR will take steps to initiate pre- employment transition services during the VR application intake appointment, so that any student who qualifies may be able to receive pre-employment transition services while on the wait list. 4. Any student with a disability who is determined eligible for VR services and placed in an open priority group can receive the full range of services offered though VR including pre- employment transition services and individualized VR services. X. Exception to Policy on OOS 1. Job retention is a priority of WIOA, and VRNH has established an exemption to the Priority Groups. The participant must be currently working and is at immediate risk of losing his or her current job and is in the need of specific services or equipment that would enable him or her to maintain that employment. 2. The VR Counselor will determine eligibility and assign a priority group based on the individual’s functional capacities. No matter what priority group the participant is assigned to or if the priority group is open or closed, this participant will receive specific services or equipment to maintain employment. 3. Documentation of immediate risk to job is required prior to providing services, e.g. letter from employer, copy of the letter of warning. 4. Services are limited to specific services or equipment necessary to maintain employment. If further services are identified, or if an array of services are needed for the individual, the individual will return to the wait list. Y. Coming off the Wait List: Once a category is open, eligible individuals will be removed 56 from the wait list based on their application date, once resources are available to serve them. They will be notified by letter and given the opportunity to develop an Individualized Plan for Employment within 90 days and receive services consistent with the plan.

DESCRIPTION: Referral is the initial or entry point into the VR process and the beginning step in case development. It begins when an individual is referred to the agency and ends when the individual either applies for VR services or the referral is closed prior to application. Individuals may refer themselves directly, or may be referred by another source. II. DEFINITIONS: Referral: A request by an individual or by another person to formally initiate participation in VRNH services for whom the following minimum information has been furnished: contact information; disability; date of birth; gender; and source of referral. III. POLICY: A. Referral Information: An individual is identified as a referral when they have been brought to the attention of NH Vocational Rehabilitation by email, online portal, American Job Center, letter, telephone, direct contact, or by other means for whom the following minimum information has been furnished: 1. Contact information (i.e., name, address, phone), 2. Disability, 3. Date of birth, 4. Gender, and 5. Source of referral. B. Source of referral: Any individual who has a disability which results in a substantial impediment to employment may be referred to VRNH and apply for services. Individuals with disabilities may: 1. seek VRNH services directly, or 2. be referred by family members, guardians, friends, schools, independent living centers, Federal, State or local agencies, medical providers, and other sources. 59 2 C. Referral Timeline: VRNH will promptly handle referrals received by the Agency. Good faith efforts shall be made to inform these individuals of application requirements and to gather information necessary to initiate an assessment for determination of eligibility in a timely fashion. To accomplish this, the Agency will make every effort to: 1. Set an appointment date for an initial interview within 24 hours of receiving the required referral information. The appointment date is scheduled for as soon as possible, and an appointment within 30 calendar days from the initial contact is offered. a. In the case of participants who require a coordinated meeting requiring others to be in attendance, (e.g., guardian, school personnel, interpreters) an appointment should be set within 5 working days of the initial contact. The appointment date should be no longer than 30 calendar days from the initial contact. 2. Reach out to individuals who have been referred who do not attend their initial interview to ascertain interest in applying. a. A second appointment will be scheduled for those who continue to express interest. b. If the individual does not respond or cannot be located, attempts to contact may end. Individuals who do not apply will have their referral closed. D. Limits: 1. The maximum time any person should remain in referral status is 90 days. 2. It should be noted that it is not intended to include in the definition of ‘referrals’ those individuals included in long lists of potential candidates for vocational rehabilitation services where it is not known if the individual, and/or their representative, is aware of the referral and/or understands what the vocational rehabilitation program is and can provide. This includes school systems who identify a list of students who may be interested in vocational rehabilitation services. a. VRNH will reach out to individuals for whom contact information has been provided to provide information about the vocational rehabilitation program and to ascertain interest in applying for services. (1) For individuals who express an interest, the minimal referral information will be collected and an initial interview appointment set. (2) For individuals who are not interested in applying, contact information should be provided for an opportunity to apply in the future. (3) For those who do not respond or cannot be located, attempts to contact may end. There is no requirement to add the potential referral to the referral module. E. Residency: There is no residency requirement for an individual to be referred and apply for services in New Hampshire if they are available in the state to participate in services, e.g., attend meetings with counselor, and participate in the steps identified in their Individual Plan for Employment (IPE). 60 3 F. Community Outreach and Referral Source Development: VRNH will develop and maintain relationships with organizations, agencies, and persons in the community in order to obtain appropriate, timely referral of individuals with disabilities for rehabilitation services. Agency staff shall inform referral sources of: 1. Services offered by the Agency, 2. The policies and procedures related to the Order of Selection/priority of services, 3. Application requirements and 4. The need to provide current medical, social, vocational, and other pertinent information for determining eligibility and priority of services. G. Referral documentation is maintained in the referral module of the electronic case management system. References: Federal Regulation: 34CFR 361.41(a) State Rules: 1010.01 61 1 401.P Referral Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Referral Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the referral procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of referrals that are made known to the Agency. Referral procedures are designed to provide information to the individual about the application process and to obtain necessary information to enter the individual into the Referral module of the electronic case management system. A referral is the entry phase into the VR process and the beginning step in case development. II. Referral Process A. When a request to be referred or to apply for VRNH Services is received the VR staff person will 1. Provide overview: VRNH staff person receiving the referral will provide a brief overview of VR services to include at least the following information: a. VRNH is an agency that works with individuals with disabilities to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment, b. The first step in the process is to apply for services, c. Individuals who apply for services are stating their intent to seek, maintain, or advance in employment, and d. Identification that the Agency is in an order of selection and status of open categories, if applicable. 2. Obtain referral information: The following information is requested of the referral: (Information required for a referral to be entered into the electronic case management system is designated by * below.) 62 2 NOTE: Do not ask for any additional personal information beyond these referral questions. Additional information will be gathered by the VR Counselor once an application is received and the applicant is provided information regarding their rights/obligations, confidentiality, and how the information gathered is used. a. *Name b. Phone Number c. *Home Address & Mailing (if different) d. Email address (if applicable) e. *Gender f. *Date of Birth g. Social Security Number (if willing, not required) h. Does the individual have a guardian? If yes, obtain guardian’s name and phone number i. *Disability j. *Referral Source k.

DESCRIPTION: The assessment process for determining eligibility begins when an individual with a disability applies for VRNH services with the intent to reach an employment outcome. Relevant assessment information may be provided by the individual, family, advocate, and/or referring agency in accordance with confidentiality requirements. The preliminary assessment ends when either the determination of eligibility is made, or the individual declines to participate in the assessment process. II. DEFINITIONS: Preliminary Assessment: The assessment of disability and related information with the specific purpose to determine eligibility; to determine the significance of disability; and to assign priority for order of selection if needed. Ability to Benefit: Likely to achieve an employment outcome with the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. Disability: A physical or mental impairment that results in a substantial impediment to employment and which is not temporary. Mental Impairment: Any mental or psychological disorder such as intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disorders. Physical Impairment: Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculo- skeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine. Requires Services: Services that are necessary for the individual to achieve competitive integrated employment. The individual would not be able to achieve employment consistent with the individual's abilities and capabilities without these vocational rehabilitation services. Substantial Impediment to Employment: A physical or mental impairment (in light of attendant medical, psychological, vocational, educational, communication, and other related factors) materially hinders an individual from preparing for, entering into, engaging in, or retaining employment consistent with the individual's abilities or capabilities. A substantial impediment to employment may be established if the impairment significantly limits one or more functional capacities of the individual in terms of an employment outcome. 75 2 III. POLICY: A. Following application, the counselor shall complete an assessment for determining eligibility or preliminary assessment 1. The assessment is conducted in accordance with the provisions of: a. The basic eligibility requirements, i.e., Physical or mental impairment; impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment for the applicant; and requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment that is consistent with the individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interest, and informed choice. For purposes of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs, an individual is presumed to have a goal of an employment outcome; b. Prohibited factors, including residency, disability, characteristics, service needs, employment outcome, referral source, employment history or current employment status, and educational status or current educational credential, c. Review and assessment of information, including existing information and any necessary additional assessments, and d. Trial work experience, as appropriate. 2. The assessment is conducted in the most integrated setting possible, consistent with the individual’s needs and informed choice. B. The VR counselor will: 1. Collect, analyze, synthesize, and interpret available information, 2. Engage the individual with a disability in the assessment process, and 3. Develop a positive counseling and guidance relationship by understanding the individual’s priorities during the assessment process. 4. If additional information is needed, the VR counselor, along with the individual receiving services, should decide how to obtain the information and establish appropriate timeframes for completion. The decision to pursue any additional assessments will also be fully discussed and explained to the individual. The VR counselor must obtain only the information that is necessary for eligibility or service planning. The individual’s active involvement should be documented in the record of services. C. The VR counselor must, to the extent possible, use existing information to establish eligibility. When additional information is needed, other assessment services may be authorized. 76 3 1. Existing information is adequate for an eligibility determination if, in the VR counselor's judgment, it sufficiently documents the person's disability, the impediments to employment, and significance of disability. If existing information is not available or sufficient for the eligibility determination, then additional assessment services may be obtained. D. An individual should be able to participate in the assessment process using the most appropriate mode of communication to enable the individual to comprehend and respond to information being communicated during the assessment process. E. The individual is expected to: 1. Work with the VR counselor to understand how the assessment process is used to determine eligibility, plan for services, and identify an employment outcome; 2. Be available for assessment services and complete any agreed-upon assessment activities; and 3. Participate in a discussion of the results and what they mean in terms of achieving an employment outcome. 4. The individual should have an opportunity to respond to assessment results and include a representative (e.g. family member or advocate) in any discussions. While the decision-making process is a collaborative one, decisions must reflect the judgment of the VR counselor in accordance with vocational rehabilitation policy. F. Focus on Functional Capacities and Employment Factors 1. Assessment should focus on the overall functional capacities of the individual. 2. Assessment should include a review of the individual’s disability and its impact on one or more functional capacities: mobility, motor skills, communication, self-care, self- direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance, and work skills. The results of the assessment process should then identify how one or more of these functional capacities impact the individual’s unique employment factors: strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. 3. Assessment should also define what supports may be provided to the individual to enhance strengths and overcome or work around limitations. For some individuals, there may be a need to experiment with the potential supports, modifications and/or strategies that will enable the individual to meet the essential performance demands of the work situation. G. The VR counselor begins the eligibility process with the presumption that all persons can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome consistent with their employment factors. The VR counselor and the individual work together to identify and understand the individual’s functional capacities, as they relate to the identified employment factors - to determine if there are substantial limitations (i.e. “impediments”) to achieving an employment outcome. 77 4 H. Trial Work Experience is used to further assess an individual when eligibility cannot be determined because of the possibility that the individual cannot benefit from VR services due to the severity of the individual’s disability. A written plan is developed for the services to be provided during a Trial Work Experience. I. Timeline: Once an individual has submitted an application for vocational rehabilitation services, including applications made through common intake procedures in one-stop centers under section 121 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), an eligibility determination must be made within sixty days, unless: 1. Exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the department preclude making an eligibility determination in sixty days and the department and the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or 2. An exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations is carried out in a trial work assessment. 78 1 404.P Preliminary Assessment Procedure Revision date: Original 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Preliminary Assessment – Determining Eligibility Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the preliminary assessment procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of determinations of eligibility made by the Agency. Preliminary assessment procedures are designed to ensure that eligibility determinations are made in a timely manner as well as in compliance with the policy. II. Preliminary Assessment Process A. After application the counselor collects documentation to verify the following experienced by the applicant, focusing on: 1. Impairment(s), 2. Impediment(s), and 3. Required services. B. As soon as there is sufficient information to make a determination of eligibility, an eligibility determination should be made. Eligibility determination should be made within the 60-day standard. C. Sources of information that may be used to substantiate a physical or mental impairment and related limitations caused by the impairment include: 1. Existing records from qualified facilities or practitioners familiar with diagnosing or treating the impairment(s) in question, especially practitioners or facilities that are currently treating the applicant. This would include records from qualified medical personnel, mental health or developmental disability programs, substance use disorder treatment clinics, and individually licensed practitioners operating within their legal scopes of practice; 2. Special Education records, including an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) which identifies the impairment; Students with disabilities receiving services under IDEA have a categorical special education disability designation. These designations align with corresponding federal 79 2 terms and requirements and/or terminology used in the field. An eligibility criterion for each designation is determined by members of a multidisciplinary education team of qualified personnel with appropriate professional credentials. Education officials responsible for the public education of students with disability are considered by VRNH to be qualified personnel for the purpose of the first criterion for eligibility under the VRNH program (determination of a physical or mental impairment); 3. Veteran’s Administration disability benefits records that identify the disability; 4. Verification of current eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Verification should identify individual is currently eligible for and receiving benefits due to their disability. This would include a copy of award letter, benefits planning query (BPQY), Benefit verification letter, check, or Ticket to Work; and 5. Verification of Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) that identifies the disability. 6. Other Considerations regarding impairment documentation a. Medical or other evaluations may be purchased or provided if other sources of documentation are not available, the nature of the disability is not stable, clearly defined, or information needed to determine the severity of the disability is not available. b. The age of diagnostic information should be appropriate to the applicant's impairment(s) and the planned use of the information. Generally, more current information will be needed if the impairment is unstable, progressive, or the diagnosis is unclear. D. The existence of a substantial impediment to employment (due to a mental or physical impairment) may be substantiated by any of the information sources noted above if the record in question addresses work or training limitations. The following information may also be used to substantiate the existence of substantial barriers to employment: 1. Counselor observation of behavioral or functional limitations of an impairment. 2. Written or verbal reports or descriptions of vocationally relevant limitations from the applicant, their representative, family members, school staff, employers, and others familiar with the individual. 3. The existence of behavioral or functional limitations alone is not sufficient to establish a substantial impediment to employment. The counselor must determine that these limitations result in a substantial, material, and significant barrier (given the individual’s training, education, and employment history) to the individual in terms of preparing for, securing, or retaining employment consistent with their abilities and capabilities. 4. Applicants who have been determined to have a disability under SSI and/or SSDI are presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services unless their ability to benefit from an employment outcome is in doubt (in coordination with Trial Work Experience policy). Verification of eligibility for SSI and/or SSDI or a copy of an SSA issued “Ticket to Work” must be on file. No further eligibility assessment is necessary. However, existing assessments from SSA and additional assessments may be obtained for a determination of vocational rehabilitation needs. 80 3 5. An applicant eligible for SSI/SSDI due to their disability can be entered into eligibility status and certified eligible for vocational rehabilitation services immediately upon verification of eligibility for SSI/SSDI by noting under all portions of the Certificate of Eligibility the individual's eligibility for SSI or SSDI (Title XVI and Title II). 6. Verification of disability for SSDI, SSI, SDA, Special Education, or Veterans Administration disability may include, for example: a. Copies of award notice or letters notifying the applicant of eligibility. b. Written confirmation of receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income (on the basis of disability) from the local Social Security office or a Ticket to Work issued by SSA. c. A copy of an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) indicating that the applicant has been determined eligible for Special Education. E. Required services are determined by a qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor based on the analysis of the information gathered to determine the impairment(s) and impediment(s). F. The assessment to determine rehabilitation needs should begin concurrently with the assessment to determine eligibility. III. Presumption of Eligibility Procedures for SSI/SSDI Verification: A. If an individual reporting receipt of SSI and/or SSDI provides documentation (e.g., copy of award letter, benefits planning query (BPQY), Benefit verification letter, proof of receipt of benefit, or Ticket to Work) to the counselor at the time of application – the counselor shall determine eligibility and move the individual's case to eligible status in the electronic case management system unless a trial work experience plan has been indicated. B. If an individual reporting receipt of SSI and/or SSDI has not provided documentation at the time of application the counselor: 1. Identifies that the SSA recipient is presumed eligible in the Initial Interview template, and 2. Confirms SSI status and SSDI status within a reasonable period of time for eligibility to be determined within 60 days of application. a. If the applicant does not have documentation at initial interview, ask to sign SSA release form. 81 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 405 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Application-Extension (Application-E) I. DESCRIPTION: In the event that an eligibility determination is not able to be completed within the 60-day timeframe extension(s) may be made under specific conditions. II. DEFINITIONS: Exceptional and Unforeseen Circumstances: Unexpected events or occurrences which prevent the completion of the next step in the process from continuing as intended. For example, bereavement, unexpected personal or family problems or illness of the participant might be considered as an exceptional circumstance. Trial Work Experiences: A process of providing assessment and related vocational rehabilitation services to an applicant with significant disabilities, for the limited purpose of collecting information necessary to make an eligibility determination, if there is concern that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the significance of their disability. Trial Work Experience for individuals with significant disabilities is an exploration of the individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations. III. POLICY: In the event an eligibility determination cannot be made within 60 days because of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of VRNH and for which the individual agrees, an Eligibility Determination Extension shall be completed in the electronic case management system and the Extension of Eligibility shall be forwarded to the individual. The Extension of Eligibility shall specify the activities to be completed and the date by which the activities shall be completed before eligibility can be determined. A. Application Extension 1. A timely eligibility determination is consistent with good customer service and is expected by prospective individuals, their families and stakeholders. However, the timeframe for determination of eligibility may be extended in two ways: a. If extenuating circumstances beyond the control of VRNH prevent eligibility determination within 60 days and the counselor and individual agree to a specific extension of time. (1) Extenuating circumstances to support an extension of time must be supported by sufficient documentation in the case record of the Counselor’s 82 2 efforts to make an eligibility determination in a timely fashion. (a) Extenuating circumstances must show the Counselor’s good faith efforts, as well as timely follow-up to obtain required documentation. (b) The counselor should not request the individual to agree to an extension of the 60 days to determine eligibility unless documentation in the case record shows efforts of at least 45 days to obtain required records. (2) If trial work experiences are required because there are concerns that an individual may not be able to benefit from services due to the severity of the Disability, trial work experiences are provided in compliance with policy on Trial Work. 83 1 405.P Application-E Procedure Revision date: 4/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Application-E Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. _ I. Introduction The purpose of the Application-E procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of applications that are made known to the Agency, including informing and demonstrating agreement with a need to extend the 60-day eligibility determination requirement in certain circumstances. Application-E procedures are designed to provide information to the individual about the eligibility process, the need to obtain necessary information to make that determination, and the need to extend the timeframe to gather needed information. II. Application-E Process: A. As identified in the preliminary assessment policy, following the application, the counselor implements activities to acquire documentation to determine eligibility for the program. B. VR Counselor documents activities and progress in gathering information needed to make a determination of eligibility. C. If the activity does not result in the receipt of needed documentation by day 40: 1. VR counselor confers with the applicant about additional activities and time needed to gather the documentation. 2. If the applicant agrees to the extension, this is case noted (if unable to gain agreement refer to steps in IV below). 3. Qualified staff completes the eligibility determination extension data page. a. If the counselor does not have signature authority to complete the extension, the VR counselor will create an Activity Due for supervisory review and approval. b. Supervisor reviews and approves draft extension, as required. 4. Once ‘agreed to extend eligibility determination until’ date is competed, form is printed and provided to the applicant and/or guardian for signature with Rights and Review cover letter. 5. The case moves to Application-E status in the electronic case management system. 84 2 6. A case note is generated to document the mutual agreement and the steps taken to obtain the applicant’s signature on the form. III. Subsequent extensions: If, because of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, the Eligibility Determination Extension expires without determining Eligibility, supervisory consultation and written approval is required before a second Eligibility Determination Extension may be executed. The supervisor will document approval and rationale for the subsequent extension in the way of a case note. If an additional Eligibility Determination Extension is warranted, an activity due is sent from the supervisor to a member of the data unit to document the additional extension end date in the other comments field of the eligibility determination extension page. The activity due should include the end date of the subsequent extension (not to exceed 60 days from prior extension end date). The Extension of Eligibility in the electronic case management system is forwarded to the applicant, documenting that they agreed to the extension. IV. Next Steps in the event staff are unable to gain applicant agreement A. The case will be closed If there is no documentation on file and the 1. applicant is not able to be reached to discuss the extension, or 2. applicant refuses to participate in the assessment including refusing to provide information, attend scheduled assessments, sign release forms. B. If the applicant does not agree to the extension 1. the applicant will be informed that the eligibility determination will need to be made based on the information currently in the possession of the Agency, 2. that this may result in the applicant being found ineligible for services and information related to the Ineligibility policy will be provided, and 3. the counselor will make the eligibility determination based on information available. 85 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 406 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 1 of 3 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Trial Work Experience (Application-T) I. DESCRIPTION: Trial Work Experience is used when there is a question as to whether an applicant is able to benefit in terms of obtaining employment as a result of vocational rehabilitation services. Prior to the Agency closing an individual as too significantly disabled to benefit from VR services, trial work experiences are provided. II. DEFINITIONS: Trial Work Experience (TWE): A process of providing assessment and related vocational rehabilitation services to an applicant with significant disabilities, for the limited purpose of collecting information necessary to make an eligibility determination, if there is concern that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the significance of their disability. Trial Work Experience for individuals with significant disabilities is an exploration of the individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations. Clear and convincing evidence: VR has a high degree of certainty to conclude that an individual is incapable of benefiting from services in terms of an employment outcome. The clear and convincing standard constitutes the highest standard used in our civil system of law and is to be individually applied on a case-by-case basis. The term clear means unequivocal. For example, the use of an intelligence test result alone would not constitute clear and convincing evidence. III. POLICY: A. A Trial Work Experience (TWE) shall be used when there are questions about an individual’s ability to benefit from VR services (i.e., achieving an employment outcome in an integrated setting, due to the severity of the disability). 1. TWE is appropriate for applicants determined to have at least a significant disability. 2. TWE must be used prior to a determination that an applicant is ineligible due to inability to benefit from VR services in terms of an employment outcome due to the severity of the disability. 86 2 B. A plan for provision of Trial Work Experiences and associated services will be developed with applicants requiring TWE to determine eligibility for Vocational Rehabilitation services. Appropriate supports and training required for trial work experiences shall be included. 1. The goal of the plan is to develop evidence that supports a determination of eligibility or clear and convincing evidence that the individual cannot benefit from services in terms of an employment outcome. 2. The plan is developed to assess the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in competitive and integrated work situations through the use of trial work experiences, which must be provided in competitive integrated employment settings to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the informed choice and rehabilitation needs of the individual. 3. The plan must specify the services to be provided, the provider, estimated costs, and the timeframes during which the service(s) will be provided. C. TWE encompass a variety of community-based, on-job activities in the most integrated setting possible, consistent with the informed choice and needs of the individual. 1. Trial work experiences may include shadowing a worker for a few hours, informational interviewing, performing volunteer work for a few days. 2. Community-based trial work experiences may be offered through Community Rehabilitation Programs as part of work adjustment or other services. 3. Trial work may also include supported employment, on-the-job training, and other experiences using realistic integrated work settings. 4. Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) may be provided for students with disabilities who have trial work plans as they are \"potentially eligible\" for services. One or more Pre-ETS may be included with traditional VR services on a trial work experience plan, and information gleaned from these experiences may be used to assist with eligibility determination. However, a student's participation in Pre-ETS may not be the only source of information used to determine eligibility or ineligibility for VRNH services, as the primary intent when providing Pre-ETS must be to increase the student's understanding of and experience with the world of work, rather than to fulfill assessment required for VR eligibility determination. D. During the Trial Work Experience the Agency must provide appropriate supports, including but not limited to assistive technology devices and services and personal assistance services, to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the individual during the trial work experiences. E. Trial work experiences must be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine that: 1. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual can benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome; or 87 3 2. There is clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome due to the severity of the individual's disability. F. Progress in Trial Work Experiences shall be assessed as often as needed, but no less than every 90 days. G. Trial Work Experiences shall be terminated as soon as there is there is sufficient evidence that the individual can benefit from services and is therefore eligible or that there is clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome, and is therefore ineligible. 88 1 406.P Trial Work Experience Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Trial Work Experience (Application-T) Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the Trial Work Experience procedure is to provide the steps to assure trial work experiences are provided in cases where there is a question whether the applicant can benefit in terms of an employment outcome. Trial Work procedures are designed to provide information to assure the participant receives adequate assessment and opportunities to determine eligibility for VR services. II. Trial Work Experiences (TWE) Process: Prior to determining that an individual with a disability is ineligible due to the inability to benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome due to the severity of that individual's disability, VR must conduct Trial Work Experience(s) to explore the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations. A. In the course of determining eligibility, if there is a question of ability to benefit, the VRC explores following questions: 1. Is the severity of the disability the reason for the uncertainty about the individual’s ability to benefit in terms of an employment outcome? a. If the answer is yes, then ask the following: (1) With appropriate supports, can this individual benefit from services in terms of a competitive, integrated employment outcome? b. If the VRC believes the answer to this question might be no, or is uncertain, then a Trial Work Plan (TWP) featuring a TWE is developed to gather information to further explore the question. B. The counselor develops a TWP with the applicant, or the applicant’s representative to assess the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in competitive integrated work situations. 89 2 1. Explore options for TWE with the applicant that will provide information to address the issues/ concerns identified– the applicant should be a full partner with the counselor in choosing trial work experience options and providers as well as support services needed to complete the TWE. a. Identify (based on identifying issues/concerns that call into question the applicant's ability to achieve an employment outcome) the question(s) that need to be addressed/answered as a result of the TWE service, and b. Consider optimal environment in which the TWE should take place. (1) Identify any appropriate supports, including, but not limited to, assistive technology devices, transportation services, and personal assistance services, to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the applicant during the TWE. (2) Complete the TWP in the electronic case management system. C. Provide services as identified in the TWP. D. Assess progress on the TWE and next steps (at least every 90 days). 1. If there is NO clear and convincing evidence that the individual cannot benefit, and the VRC’s concerns and questions were addressed, then VRC should proceed to eligibility. 2. If the VRC still has concerns about the individual’s ability to benefit and/or the TWE was inconclusive, an additional TWE should be authorized. 3. If there IS clear and convincing evidence that individual cannot benefit, then VRC should proceed with ineligibility determination. E. When there is sufficient information, determine eligibility in compliance with Eligibility policy. F. When there is sufficient information to determine ineligibility: 1. The VRC reviews activity to assure that the TWEs were provided in an integrated setting and included known or likely to be needed supports to ensure a valid assessment of the individual was completed. 2. The VRC must be able to identify the specific reason(s) that the individual’s ability to benefit, due to severity of the disability, is in question (e.g., individual displays frequent, highly aggressive behaviors when frustrated, or with any small disruption in routine). 3. The ineligibility is completed in compliance with the Ineligibility policy. 90 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 407 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 4 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Significance and Priority / Criteria for categorization of significance of disability I. DESCRIPTION: Vocational Rehabilitation New Hampshire (VRNH) is committed to serving individuals with significant disabilities. Assigning and tracking levels of significance assures that we are reaching individuals with significant disabilities, and in the event that VRNH is unable to provide vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals, establishing priority categories also enables VRNH to transition should an Order of Selection become necessary. II. DEFINITIONS: Individual with a significant disability: An individual with a disability— A. Who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacities (such as mobility, motor skills, communication, self-care, self- direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance, or work skills) in terms of an employment outcome; B. Whose vocational rehabilitation can be expected to require multiple vocational rehabilitation services over an extended period of time; and C. Who has one or more physical or mental disabilities resulting from amputation, arthritis, autism, blindness, burn injury, cancer, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, deafness, head injury, heart disease, hemiplegia, hemophilia, respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, musculo-skeletal disorders, neurological disorders (including stroke and epilepsy), spinal cord conditions (including paraplegia and quadriplegia), sickle cell anemia, intellectual disability, specific learning disability, end-stage renal disease, or another disability or combination of disabilities determined on the basis of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs to cause comparable substantial functional limitation. Individual with a Most Significant Disability: An individual who meets the definition of significant disability and; A. Who has a severe mental or physical impairment that seriously limits 3 or more functional capacities such as mobility, communication, self-care, self-direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance and work skills, or work tolerance or work skills in terms of employment outcomes; and Whose vocational rehabilitation can be expected to require 3 or more vocational rehabilitation services, over an extended period of time of 6 months or longer. 91 2 Individual with a Less Significant Disability: An individual determined eligible for services but does not meet the criteria for having a significant or most significant disability. Mobility: The ability to move from place to place inside and outside the home. Communication: The ability to effectively exchange information through words or concepts (writing, speaking, listening, sign language, or other adaptive methods). Self-care: The ability to manage oneself or ones living environment (including but not limited to eating, toileting, grooming, dressing, money management, and medication compliance) as they affect the individual’s ability to participate in services or work-related activities. Self-direction: The ability to plan, initiate, problem solve, organize and independently carry out goal-directed activities related to self-care, socialization, recreation, and work. Interpersonal Skills: The ability to establish and maintain personal, family, community, and work relationships. Motor Skills: A person’s purposeful movement and control of the body and its members to achieve specific results to the degree necessary to get and keep a job. Pre-employment transition services: The required activities and authorized activities specified in 33 CFR 361.48(a)(2) and (3). Trial Work Experiences (TWE): A process of providing assessment and related vocational rehabilitation services to an applicant with significant disabilities, for the limited purpose of collecting information necessary to make an eligibility determination, if there is concern that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the significance of their disability. Trial Work Experience for individuals with significant disabilities is an exploration of the individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations. Work tolerance: The capacity to perform effectively and efficiently jobs that require various levels of physical and/or psychological demand, for at least a partial work day. Work Skills: The ability to perform specific tasks required to carry out job functions, the capacity to benefit from training in the necessary skills, and the capacity to practice the work habits needed to stay employed. III. POLICY A. Overview: The VRNH counselor must identify an individual as having a most significant, significant, or less significant disability without delaying the eligibility decision. The 92 3 determination is based on the individual’s functional capacities, the services needed to reduce the impact of disability-related limitations, and the duration of the rehabilitation services required for the individual to achieve an employment outcome. Significance of disability is not based on a specific diagnosis or disability. Significance of disability is determined using existing information and may be changed at any time during the life of the case. B. When operating under an Order of Selection, that order shall be determined on the basis of serving first those individuals with the most significant disabilities. VRNH allocates case service funds in a manner that ensures this priority status in the delivery of rehabilitation services. C. Determination of priority category is based on the disability and its impact on employment. There must be clear evidence, demonstration, or documentation of the limitations imposed by the disability. D. Individuals may have a number of other compelling factors, aside from the disability, affecting their ability to achieve employment, including poverty, limited English proficiency, and lack of family support. These related factors would need to be taken into account in rehabilitation planning if the individual were determined eligible and could be served under the Order of Selection. However, such related factors are not to be included as a basis for determination of severity of disability and priority category. E. A recipient of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments by reason of disability meets at least the SD criteria. F. Required Timeline for Determining Severity: The determination that an individual has a most significant or significant disability shall be made: 1. Concurrent with the determination of eligibility in order to identify whether the eligible individual meets Order of Selection/Priority criteria and can therefore be provided services, or 2. Prior to the Trial Work Plan, during which the Disability Priority page must reflect either a determination of significant or most significant disability. (Trial Work Experiences are used only when there are questions concerning an applicant’s ability to benefit from services in terms of an employment outcome due to the severity of the disability.) G. Priority/Order of Selection 1. Vocational rehabilitation services shall be provided based upon availability of funds. Because sufficient funds are not available to provide vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals, the VRNH has instituted an Order of Selection which has been in effect since May 2018. 2. The Order of Selection does not apply to potentially eligible students with disabilities when requesting only Pre-Employment Transition Services. 93 4 H. Order of Selection Categories 1. Individuals applying for or receiving services shall be placed in priority categories. Depending upon VRNH resources, the categories shall be closed for services in ascending order beginning with Category 3 and proceeding to Categories 2 and1. Services shall be provided only to those individuals in an open category. However, VRNH shall continue to implement plans for and provide services to any individual in plan prior to the date on which the Order of Selection category to which the individual has been assigned has been closed, irrespective of the severity of the individual’s disability. 2. Under the order of selection, VRNH will continue to emphasize and enhance services to students with disabilities transitioning from school to work. 3. VRNH staff will be advised via formal notice when categories are closed or reopened. 4. The Order of Selection categories are as follows: a. Category 1: Individuals with the Most Significant Disabilities b. Category 2: Individuals with Significant Disabilities c. Category 3: Individuals with Less-Significant Disabilities I. Notification of the Individual of Priority Status 1. The counselor will notify all eligible individuals of: a. The priority categories in the Order of Selection, b. Their assignment to a particular category, and c. Their right to appeal their assignment to Category 2 or 3. 94 1 407.P Significance and Priority Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Significance and Priority Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the significance and priority procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of a priority assignment to individuals who are found eligible for vocational rehabilitation services. II. Significance and Priority Assignment Process: In conjunction with the determination of eligibility the VR Counselor reviews and assigns the individual to a priority category by determining the level of significance. 7. Disability Priority Page A. Disabling Condition section: VR Counselor reviews documentation of the impairment(s) to identify if the disability meets one of the disabilities identified as ‘severe’. 1. If yes, VR Counselor checks appropriate box(es) on disability priority page. 2. If yes due to Social Security documentation, but do not have a specific diagnosis, VR Counselor checks the box and writes rationale in the text box. The rationale would be ‘Receives SSA benefits as a result of their disability’. 3. If no, VR Counselor leaves the boxes unchecked. 4. If no, however, individual has another disability or combination of disabilities that causes comparable substantial functional limitation, VR Counselor checks the box and writes rationale in the text box. The rationale needs to describe specifically how that disability, or combination of disabilities does cause that comparable substantial functional limitation. B. Functional Limitation options: VR Counselor identifies functional limitations that have reached a level of serious by checking the appropriate boxes. 1. VR Counselor assures that the functional limitations checked are supported by documentation in file. 2. If a functional limitation area is serious for an individual and none of the options fit the limitations the individual is experiencing, VR Counselor chooses the ‘Other’ option and includes rationale in the appropriate narrative box (bottom of page). 95 2 C. Estimated Number of VR Services Required: VR Counselor identifies the services that are required by the individual in order to achieve an employment outcome by checking the boxes that correspond to those services. Note: services checked in this section should match services identified on Eligibility Determination data page. D. VR Counselor answers questions at bottom of the page. 1. Is the participant’s disability/combination of disabilities severe? (drop down) a. Yes option chosen if one of the boxes under 1. Disabling Condition section is checked. b. No option is chosen if none of the boxes under 1. Disabling Condition are checked. 2. Estimated Number of VR Services (textbox): Enter the number of services that are checked under ‘Estimated Number of VR Services Required’. 3. Estimated Months of VR Services (textbox): Enter the number of months estimated to complete the identified required services including 90-day follow up after provision of those services. E. Reason(s) for Selecting Estimated Length of Services (textbox): VR Counselor enters narrative rationale to support the number of months entered under 3. Estimated Months of VR Services above. F. VR Counselor scrolls to top of page and clicks ‘Calculate’ button. G. VR Counselor reviews level of significance to ascertain if it matches their expectation. 1. If yes, leave page by clicking the ‘Finish’ tab at the top of the page. 2. If no, review the page to assure that all the information is correctly entered. Once resolved, leave page by clicking the ‘Finish’ tab at the top of the page. 8. Eligibility Case Note H. If not already completed the VR Counselor completes the eligibility case note to include: 1. Disability: Identification of the impairment(s) and the source of the documentation verifying the impairment(s) 2. Impediment/Functional limitation: Rationale for identifying the impediments/functional limitations for eligibility and for identifying those chosen as serious on the Disability Priority page 3. Required Services: Rationale for identifying services as required 4. Contributing and other factors: This many Include other factors that were not used in the eligibility determination or priority assignment, but may impact vocational rehab planning (e.g., things to get additional information about, transportation not related to disability, child care needs). 9. For the purposes of disability assignment Mobility – A serious limitation in mobility exists if, due to the disability, the person requires assistance from others to get around in the community; or if the individual requires modifications, adaptive technology, or accommodations (not typically made for other workers) in order to move around the community; or if the person needs specialized training to learn to move around in the community. 96 3 The following circumstances do not constitute serious, disability-related limitations in mobility, though they may be considered in rehabilitation planning as related factors: Absence of or limitations in public transportation available in a geographic area; loss of driving privileges because of accumulation of points and/or charges such as DWI; lack of a personal vehicle. Motor Skills - a person’s purposeful movement and control of the body and its members to achieve specific results to the degree necessary to get and keep a job Communication – A serious limitation in communication exists if the disability results in severely impaired expressive or receptive communication, either oral or written, and to be able to communicate effectively, the individual requires modifications, adaptive technology, or accommodations not typically made for other workers. Upon first contact, the individual may not be readily understood by others or may not understand others. Communications problems stemming from a language or cultural difference that are not disability based would not constitute serious limitations in communication, though they would need to be considered in rehabilitation planning. Self-care – Limitations may occur because of physical, cognitive, or emotional impairments and could impact all tasks or only specific tasks. A serious limitation in self-care exists if the disability results in the individual being dependent upon other individuals, services, or devices to manage themselves or their living environment. Lack of or limited financial resources affecting self-care would not constitute serious limitations in self-care because it is not disability-related. However, such factors would need to be considered in rehabilitation planning. Self-direction - A serious limitation in self-direction exists if due to the disability the individual is confused or disoriented, or requires assistance or intervention on an ongoing basis or during episodes in order to perform tasks, monitor own behavior, and make decisions. General impulsivity and lack of focus, often characteristics of teenagers, would not in and of themselves constitute a serious limitation in self-direction for transitioning students, but would need to be considered in rehabilitation planning. Interpersonal Skills – A serious limitation in interpersonal skills means that due to the disability the individual has no or limited ability to interact with others in a socially acceptable manner or is unable to relate to peers or co-workers without exhibiting inappropriate behaviors. Immaturity, which is a common characteristic of teenagers and may be expressed as lack of developed communication skills, in and of itself does not constitute a serious limitation in interpersonal skills. Such traits, however, should be considered in rehabilitation planning. 97 4 Work tolerance –A serious limitation in work tolerance exists when the individual will require modification, adaptive technology, or accommodations (not typically made for other workers) in terms of capacity or endurance. For example, the individual may not be able to sustain an 8- hour workday, meet production standards, or perform at a consistent pace without frequent rest breaks. Individuals who could work full time but choose to work less than full time in order to retain benefits or for other reasons are not considered to have a serious limitation in work tolerance. Work Skills –A serious limitation in work skills exists when the disability results in an inability to obtain or maintain employment normally available to persons of equivalent age, education, training, or experience. In order to acquire work skills, the person requires modifications, adaptive technology, or accommodations not typically made for other workers. Lack of work skills, for example, of transitioning youth because of age, does not in and of itself constitute a serious limitation in work skills, but may be considered as a related factor in rehabilitation planning. Anticipated difficulty in achieving work skills, and requirements for AT and other modifications, aside from absence of work experience, may be considered in determining limitations related to work skills. In determining whether there are serious limitations in work skills, consider the impact of the disability on specific employment goals rather than on the universe of jobs. For example, a math impairment may have a significant impact on an individual’s ability to be an engineer, but little impact on many other careers, including rehabilitation counselor or DDS examiner. 98 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 508 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 4 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Eligibility I. DESCRIPTION: An eligibility determination is made following the preliminary assessment. Eligibility is based on specific criteria as outlined in this policy. II. DEFINITIONS: Applicant: An individual who submits a completed and signed application for vocational rehabilitation services; provides information necessary to initiate an assessment to determine eligibility and priority for services; and is available to complete the assessment process. Eligible individual: An applicant for vocational rehabilitation services who meets the eligibility requirements of 34 CFR 361.42(a). Extended employment: Work in a non-integrated or sheltered setting for a public or private nonprofit agency or organization that provides compensation in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. Individual with a disability: An individual who has a physical or mental impairment; whose impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment; and who can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. Physical or mental impairment: Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculo-skeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or any mental or psychological disorder such as intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. Substantial impediment: A physical or mental impairment (in light of attendant medical, psychological, vocational, educational, communication, and other related factors) hinders an individual from preparing for, entering into, engaging in, advancing in, or retaining employment consistent with the individual’s abilities and capabilities. 99 2 Trial Work Experiences (TWE): A process of providing assessment and related vocational rehabilitation services to an applicant with significant disabilities, for the limited purpose of collecting information necessary to make an eligibility determination, if there is concern that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the significance of their disability. Trial Work Experience for individuals with significant disabilities is an exploration of the individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in realistic work situations. III. POLICY: A. Overview: In order to determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services the counselor must conduct an assessment for determining eligibility. The assessment must be conducted in the most integrated setting possible, consistent with the individual’s needs and informed choice, and in accordance with the following provisions: basic eligibility requirements, prohibited factors, review and assessment of data, and as necessary, the opportunity for trial work experiences prior to a determination of eligibility. B. Timeline: The counselor shall determine eligibility for services within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days from the date of application as documented in the electronic case management system. Exceptions to the 60-day timeline will be made in accordance with policy on Eligibility Extension. C. Basic eligibility requirements: An applicant’s eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based only on the following requirements: 1. A determination that the applicant has a physical or mental impairment. 2. A determination that the applicant’s physical or mental impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment for the applicant. 3. A determination that the applicant requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment that is consistent with the applicant’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. D. Intent to achieve an employment outcome: For the purposes of determining eligibility an individual is presumed to have a goal of an employment outcome. 1. Any eligible individual, including an individual whose eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services is based on the individual being eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act due to their disability, must intend to achieve an employment outcome that is consistent with the applicant’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. 2. Counselors shall ensure that applicants understand that extended employment (non- integrated or sheltered employment) is not an allowable employment outcome for vocational rehabilitation. 100 3 3. The applicant's completion of the application process for vocational rehabilitation services is sufficient evidence of the individual's intent to achieve an employment outcome, and no additional demonstration on the part of the applicant is required. E. Presumption of eligibility for Social Security recipients and beneficiaries: any applicant who has been determined eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act as a result of their disability is— 1. Presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services, and 2. Considered an individual with a significant disability. F. VRNH will presume that an applicant who meets the eligibility requirements can benefit in terms of employment unless it demonstrates, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the applicant is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from Vocational Rehabilitation due to the severity of the disability. 1. Use of trial work experiences to determine whether an individual may benefit from VR services in terms of an employment outcome should be required on an exceptional basis. While the Rehabilitation Act allows for the possibility that an individual may be \"incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability,\" counselors are encouraged to convey and act in accordance with an optimistic belief that individuals even with the most significant disabilities can work if provided needed supports. G. Prohibited Factors: The following factors shall not be considered in determining eligibility: 1. Residency: No duration of residence requirement shall be imposed that excludes from services any applicant who is present in the State. 2. Disability: No applicant or group of applicants shall be excluded or found ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability. 3. Characteristics: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to the age, gender, race, color, creed, national origin, financial status, or sexual orientation of the applicant. 4. Service needs: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to the particular service needs or anticipated costs of services required by the applicant or the applicant’s family. 5. Employment outcome: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to type of expected employment outcome. 6. Referral Source: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to the source of referral for vocational rehabilitation services. 7. Applicant’s employment history or current employment status: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to the employment history or current employment status of the applicant. 8. Applicant’s educational status or current educational credential: Eligibility requirements shall be applied without regard to the educational status or current educational credential of the applicant. 101 4 H. Supporting Documentation: Review and assessment of data for eligibility determination must be based on: 1. A review and assessment of existing data, including counselor observations, education records, information provided by the individual or the individual's family, particularly information used by education officials, and determinations made by officials of other agencies. 2. To the extent existing data do not describe the current functioning of the individual or are unavailable, insufficient, or inappropriate to make an eligibility determination, an assessment of additional data resulting from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services, including trial work experiences, assistive technology devices and services, personal assistance services, and any other support services that are necessary to determine whether an individual is eligible. 3. In the case of an applicant who is currently eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act due to their disability, as evidenced by recent verification documentation, the Agency presumes that the individual meets each of the basic eligibility requirements. I. Certification of eligibility: upon completion of the eligibility assessment, the counselor shall make and certify one of the following decisions: 1. Eligibility - For each individual determined eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation services, the case record must include a statement of eligibility, and must be electronically dated in the case management system. 2. Ineligibility (in accordance with policy on Ineligibility). J. Notification of eligibility decision: The applicant shall be notified in writing, using appropriate modes of communication, and in the individual's native language if necessary, of the action taken on eligibility or ineligibility. K. Nothing in this section is to be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service. 102 1 405.P Eligibility Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Eligibility Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the Eligibility procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of determinations of an applicant’s eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services. Eligibility determination procedures provide guidelines regarding the completion of the eligibility determination. II. Eligibility Determination Process: A. VR Counselor plans, monitors, and follows up on activities identified to gather required information. This is to assure adequate progress is made to complete the determination within 60 days of application (or by the agreed-upon eligibility determination extension date). The case service record will contain documentation used by the counselor to determine the individual’s eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services. B. Once documentation is collected that substantiates impairment, impediment, and identified required services, the Counselor can complete the eligibility determination. 1. Documentation of physical or mental disability(ies) and/or a copy of an award letter, benefits planning query (BPQY), Benefit verification letter, Ticket to Work, or recent proof of receipt of benefit confirming that the individual receives SSI or SSDI. 2. Information regarding the functional capabilities of the individual. 3. Other information as appropriate. C. VR Counselor reviews documentation to complete the: 1. Eligibility case note, 2. Disability Priority page (in accordance with significance of disability policy),and 3. The Eligibility Determination Page 103 2 a. Review disability(ies) included on page as primary, secondary, and other to assure they are entered accurately and are supported by documentation in the case record, b. Impediments Options, and c. Eligibility Rationale Options (required services). d. Prior to dating, or preparing an activity due for supervisory review and approval, assure that all necessary data is entered in the system by clicking on the ‘Check To Do Indicator’ button. (This will list outstanding items to be completed). D. Qualified staff review the case service record and complete the eligibility determination by entering the Eligibility Date in the electronic case management system. 1. If the counselor does not have signature authority to complete the Eligibility Determination, the VR Counselor will create an Activity Due for supervisory review and approval. 2. Supervisor reviews and approves draft eligibility determination and disability priority assignment. E. Generate and mail to the participant the appropriate Eligibility Determination letter from the electronic case management system. F. Assure that all documentation is appropriately completed and attached in the electronic case management system. G. Follow up with Participant to work on plan development activities. 104 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 409 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Comprehensive Assessment I. DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive assessment (CA) is used to identify the vocational goal and the services that are needed to reach that goal. During CA the counselor assists the participant to gather and assess information to develop an IPE. II. DEFINITIONS: Integrated setting: A. With respect to the provision of services, a setting typically found in the community in which applicants or eligible individuals interact with non- disabled individuals other than non- disabled individuals who are providing services to those applicants or eligible individuals; and B. With respect to an employment outcome, a setting— 1. Typically found in the community; and 2. Where the employee with a disability interacts, for the purpose of performing the duties of the position, with other employees within the particular work unit and the entire work site, and, as appropriate to the work performed, other persons (e.g., customers and vendors) who are not individuals with disabilities (not including supervisory personnel or individuals who are providing services to such employee) to the same extent that employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with these persons. III. POLICY: A. To develop an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) with the participant, VRNH conducts an assessment for determining vocational rehabilitation needs, if appropriate, for each eligible individual, or if the Agency is operating under an Order of Selection, for each eligible individual to whom VRNH is able to provide services. B. The purpose of this assessment is to determine the employment outcome, and the nature and scope of vocational rehabilitation services to be included in the Individualized Plan for Employment. 105 2 C. The comprehensive assessment: 1. is limited to information necessary to identify the rehabilitation needs of the eligible individual and to develop the individual's IPE, 2. uses existing information as the primary source of information, 3. relies on information provided by the individual and other sources, in accordance with confidentiality requirements, 4. may include an assessment of the personality, interests, interpersonal skills, intelligence and related functional capacities, educational achievements, work experience, vocational aptitudes, personal and social adjustments, and employment opportunities of the individual, and the medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other pertinent vocational, educational, cultural, social, recreational, and environmental factors that affect the employment and rehabilitation needs of the individual, 5. may include, to the degree needed, an appraisal of the patterns of work behavior of the individual and services needed for the individual to acquire occupational skills, and to develop work attitudes, work habits, work tolerance, and social and behavior patterns necessary for successful job performance, including the use of work in real job situations to assess and develop the capacities of the individual to perform adequately in a work environment, 6. includes referral, where appropriate, for rehabilitation (assistive) technology services to assess and develop the capacities of the individual to perform in a work environment, 7. must substantiate that the individual meets all criteria for participation in the supported employment program if supported employment will be included in the employment outcome, and 8. must be conducted in the most integrated setting possible. 106 1 409.P Comprehensive Assessment Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Comprehensive Assessment Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction Comprehensive assessment procedures are designed to provide information to ensure a complete and timely comprehensive assessment. Comprehensive assessment is used to identify the vocational goal and the services that are needed to reach that goal II. Comprehensive Assessment Process A. VR Counselor will begin working with a participant who is eligible and in an open priority category as soon as possible to develop the IPE in accordance with the IPE policy. B. If the Agency has all categories open, this activity may start after application for VR services. C. VR Counselor will, after review of existing information, determine what information is needed to assist the participant to identify: 1. Vocational goal, 2. Nature and scope of services, including service provider and cost, 3. Financial need, if applicable, 4. Comparable benefits, if applicable, 5. Criteria for review, 6. Availability of extended supports, if applicable (SEP), and 7. Other information needs. D. VR Counselor will work with the participant to identify sources of additional information and/or activities to complete to gather the needed information. E. The VR Counselor should: 107 2 1. involve the participant in providing and securing existing assessment information to the maximum extent possible, 2. assure the participant understands the purpose and need for any additional assessments that are to be completed, if needed, 3. explore the use of self-assessment tools in facilitating self-awareness and development, as needed, and 4. offer the opportunity to select from among appropriate types of assessment services and service providers should purchase of assessment services be needed. F. Once assessment information has been obtained, the counselor and applicant should fully discuss findings and their relevance to an identification of the individual's strengths, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and barriers to employment and how these may affect vocational planning decisions. G. VR Counselor will record in case notes activities and progress throughout the comprehensive assessment. H. VR staff will attach documentation received during the comprehensive assessment to the electronic case management system. I. VR Counselor will record on the electronic case management system’s Comprehensive Assessment data page (sections 7 – 10) 1. Vocational Goal Rationale: to include an explanation of why the IPE vocational goal is appropriate for the participant, to include, but not limited to the following information a. compatibility with abilities and impediments, b. participant participation in selection of goal, c. availability in geographic area labor market, and d. sufficiency of income to meet participant needs. 2. Vocational Services Rationale: To include an explanation of why the services in the IPE are both necessary and sufficient to meet the rehabilitation needs that have been identified to reach the vocational goal. J. If necessary, staff will contact the participant to discuss the need for an extension and obtain participant signature on the Plan Development extension as soon as the need for an extension is apparent and prior to the end of the 90-calendar day timeline (Eligible-E policy). K. Begin the writing of the IPE (in conjunction with IPE policy). 108 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 410 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Plan Development Extension (Eligible – E) I. DESCRIPTION: There are instances where the participant and counselor need additional time, beyond the 90-day standard, to complete the comprehensive assessment and identify an employment goal and the services needed to reach that goal. An extension may be made under specific circumstances. II. DEFINITIONS: Student with a disability: an individual with a disability in a secondary, postsecondary, or other recognized education program who— A. Is not younger than the earliest age for the provision of transition services under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(VIII)); and B. Is not older than 21 years of age. III. POLICY: A. Extension of 90-day timeframe: In the event that the Individualized Plan for Employment cannot be completed 90 days after the date of determination of eligibility (or release from wait list, if the Agency is in an Order of Selection), the timeframe for development may be extended if, VRNH and the eligible individual agree to the extension of that deadline to a specific date by which the Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) must be completed. 1. The extension should be completed prior to or on day 90. 2. An extension of the IPE development timeframe will only be considered after 60 of the 90 days for plan development have elapsed. B. Should the participant decline to extend the time, or is not available to participate in the extension, the case will be closed. C. If multiple extensions are needed, VR staff shall evaluate the individual’s progress with services and take additional steps to move participant into a plan, create additional extensions, or close the case if participant is not making timely progress. 109 2 1. For students in high school who are eligible for VRNH services, the IPE shall be developed and completed before the student leaves the school setting. An agreed upon delay in developing an IPE is not an option for eligible transition students if the delay in development extends beyond the student’s exit from school. The only exception to this practice is when a student is referred to VRNH too late in the final semester to allow for a timely determination of VRNH eligibility prior to the student leaving the school setting. In this instance, the counselor shall apply timeliness standards for IPE development as noted in general 90-day requirement procedures. 110 1 410.P Plan Development Extension Procedure (Eligible – E) Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Plan Development Extension Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the time extension for IPE procedure is to ensure fair and equitable processing of an IPE development extension when exceptional circumstances require additional time to complete the plan. II. Time extension for IPE Process A. VR Counselor works with participant to develop the IPE as soon as possible, no later than 90 days after determination of eligibility (or release from wait list). B. All contact and activities are documented in the case service record. C. VR Counselor contacts individual prior to the end of the 90-day deadline to explain why the IPE cannot be completed and requests their agreement to a specific extension date. 1. Participant declines: a. Provide explanation of 90-day requirement and consequences for not extending the deadline. b. Work with participant the remaining time of 90 days to attempt to complete plan activities. c. Close case on day 90 if plan not developed and agreement has not been reached and participant is still not willing to agree to an extension. d. Inform participant of decision to close case and right to appeal, including availability of the Client Assistance Program (CAP). 2. Participant unreachable: a. VRC attempts to contact participant. If after a minimum of two (2) attempts using multiple methods of communication, if available, the VRC has been unable to connect, VR staff should inform the participant of intent to close, and close the case should there be no response. 111 2 D. Complete the “Plan Development Extension” page in the electronic case management system and if not completing in person, send the extension form to the individual for signature and document method sent. 1. The reason for the extension and deadline (i.e. specific date) for developing the IPE shall be clearly documented on the Plan development extension. 2. Examples of reasons include: a. Vocational counseling and guidance has not been completed: Despite efforts to guide participant, additional time is needed for guidance and counseling to assist the individual in selecting a vocational goal or services, b. Participant is exploring a self-employment outcome and additional time is needed to first develop a business plan (or proposal) and research financial resources, c. Additional information is needed to determine nature and scope of services to include in the plan (example: assessments to determine needs for vehicle modification), d. Inadequate Information: Despite prompt attempts to request records, information necessary to adequately complete the comprehensive assessment has not been received or is not available. Additional assessment may be required, or e. Individual is temporarily unavailable, through no fault of his/her own to develop his/her IPE (e.g. illness, hospitalization, relocation). E. If the extension is not completed prior to the 90-day deadline, VR Counselor creates a Case Note documenting the reason and follows up with the participant to gain the extension or to close the case. F. If subsequent time extensions are needed, VR Counselor will contact the individual prior to the end of the previous extension date and follow the requirements above. 1. In the event of multiple extensions, the counselor should assess the reason that necessitates the extensions. If extensions are due to a lack of participation or availability of the participant, consideration to closing the case should be given. 2. Subsequent extensions require supervisory review and approval. 112 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 411 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 7 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) I. DESCRIPTION: The Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) is a written plan that identifies: • The employment outcome, also referred to as the employment goal, • The services that will be provided to achieve the employment goal and the time frames for those services, and • The steps that will measure progress toward the employment goal.

During the process of developing the IPE, the individual will be informed of their rights and responsibilities and the steps necessary to achieve an employment outcome. The counselor and the eligible individual agree on the criteria to evaluate progress toward the employment goal. Individuals with disabilities must be active and responsible participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making informed, yet practical and realistic, choices about the selection of their employment goal, the vocational rehabilitation services they receive, and the providers of those services. II. DEFINITIONS: Employment outcome: Full-time or, if appropriate, part-time competitive integrated employment, (including customized employment, self-employment, telecommuting, or business ownership), or supported employment that is consistent with an individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.

Provided to a youth with a most significant disability by the designated State unit in accordance with requirements set forth in this part and part 363 for a period not to exceed four years, or at such time that a youth reaches age 25 and no longer meets the definition of a youth with a disability, whichever occurs first. The designated State unit may not provide extended services to an individual with a most significant disability who is not a youth with a most significant disability. Supported employment: Competitive integrated employment, including customized employment, or employment in an integrated work setting in which an individual with a most significant disability, including a youth with a most significant disability, is working on a short-term basis toward competitive integrated employment that is individualized, and customized, consistent with the unique strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual, including with ongoing support services for individuals with the most significant disabilities— A. For whom competitive integrated employment has not historically occurred, or for whom competitive integrated employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of a significant disability; and B. Who, because of the nature and severity of their disabilities, need intensive supported employment services and extended services after the transition from support provided by the designated State unit, in order to perform this work.

I. Introduction The purpose of the IPE procedure is to ensure fair, equitable, and timely development of an IPE. The IPE provides the ‘road map’ for assisting the participant to achieve their vocational goal(s). This dynamic tool assists the participant and the VR Counselor to assure agreement on key needed information. The plan also provides a framework for assessing progress toward achieving the goal. II. IPE Process A. VR Counselor will begin working with an individual who is eligible and in an open priority category as soon as possible to develop the IPE in accordance with this policy. 1. If necessary, staff will contact the individual to discuss the need for an extension and obtain individual signature on the Plan Development extension as soon as the need for an extension is apparent and prior to the end of the 90-calendar day timeline (in accordance with Eligible, and Eligible-E policy). B. Individual Notification 1. VR Counselor will provide information to the individual on options for developing an IPE including information on: a. IPE mandatory elements, and b. Appeal rights, including the availability of the Client Assistance Program (CAP). C. Financial need assessment, in the development of the IPE 1. VR Counselor will inform the individual of the requirement to determine financial need prior to the development of the IPE: a. VR staff will collect financial documentation to determine the individual’s economic need in accordance with financial need policy. b. If the individual refuses to have their need determined, or fails to provide the financial documentation required to determine need, the individual will be informed that any VR service dependent on economic need will be the responsibility of the individual. 120 2 D. Comparable benefit search in the development of the IPE 1. VR Counselor will inform the individual of the requirement to seek out comparable benefit, as necessary prior to the provision of services a. VR staff will collect comparable benefit information to determine VR participation in services in accordance with comparable benefit policy. b. If the individual refuses to search, apply for, or fails to provide the documentation required to demonstrate they have sought out comparable benefits, the individual will be informed that any VR service dependent on comparable benefit will be the responsibility of the individual. E. VR Counselor completes the IPE with the participant 1. VR Counselor will enter the IPE on the Plan data page in the electronic case management system. 2. VR staff will scan supporting documentation, e.g. labor market information, assessments, and informational interviews into the electronic case management system. 3. VR Counselor will complete an IPE justification using the Comprehensive Assessment template in the electronic case management system (sections 7 – 9) and include the following information: a. Review of the activities of the Comprehensive Assessment by identifying assessment and career exploration activities completed Labor Market information that supports the employment outcome (section 7); b. Vocational Goal Rationale (section 8) to include: (1) explanation as to why the IPE vocational goal is appropriate for the participant, (2) goal compatibility with abilities and impediments, (3) participant participation in selection of goal, (4) availability in geographic area labor market, and (5) sufficiency of income to meet participant needs). c. Vocational Services Rationale (Section 8): (1) Explanation as to why the services in the IPE are both necessary and sufficient to meet the rehabilitation needs that have been identified to reach the vocational goal. 4. VR Counselor provides participant with information on a. Individual rights and responsibilities to include information about: (1) The Client Assistance Program, and (2) The Appeal Process. b. Provision of services including that VRNH will not pay for services which have not been pre-approved and authorized in writing by an VRNH official. 5. VR Counselor will obtain necessary signatures on the IPE: a. Individual’s signature, b. VR Counselor signature, c. Supervisor signature, as required, and d. Additional approvals, as required (e.g., above $20,000). 121 3 6. VR staff will scan the signed document into the electronic case management system, or attach electronic copy (e.g., DocuSign). III. Considerations in Developing the IPE: The IPE is developed based on the information identified in the comprehensive assessment (Comprehensive Assessment policy) A. General 1. VR Counselor takes into account the individual’s strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual in the development of the IPE. 2. If the individual chooses to prepare the IPE themselves or with assistance from outside VRNH, a draft IPE will be developed and discussed with the VRNH counselor prior to the counselor considering approval of the IPE. Options and instructions for completing the IPE along with Important Information about VRNH are attached to the hard copy IPE. The counselor will assure that information from an approved IPE developed by the participant on a print IPE is entered into the electronic case management system as soon as possible. 3. The IPE will be effective, and services/activities will begin following the approval and signature of the rehabilitation counselor and the approval/signature of the supervisor (approval/signature of the supervisor is not required if the counselor has delegated authority). a. Approval (dating the IPE in the electronic case management system) constitutes supervisory signatory. 4. Signature and date – All parties required to sign the IPE or IPE amendment, including the participant, counselor and, as appropriate, supervisor, must also include the date signed. 5. In the event VR staff do not agree to support the individual’s chosen employment outcome, services, or service providers, VR staff will provide the individual with: a. Decision letter; and b. Information on Appeal Rights B. IPE Development for Students with Disabilities 1. The IPE for students with disabilities in high school who have been determined eligible for VRNH services and who meet OOS criteria will be developed within 90 days of eligibility, or prior to high school exit, whichever is first. 2. VR Rehabilitation counselor reviews IPE and when applicable, assures that the IPE is coordinated with the individualized education program (IEP) for the individual in terms of the goals, objectives, and services identified in the IEP. 3. When drafting the IPE for a high school student planning to achieve a high school diploma or for a youth or adult pursuing a HiSET or External Diploma, select the corresponding Participant Responsibility checkbox, stating, “I am and will continue working to obtain my high school diploma or its equivalent”. Do not select this checkbox for a student planning to exit high school with a special education Certificate of Completion. 122 4 4. IPE includes pre-employment transition services. C. IPE Development for Self-Employment – VRNH supports employment goals of self- employment for individuals for whom it is appropriate. IPE development for such individuals shall be in accordance with self-employment policy and requires approval of the Regional Leader (Tier 1) or Director, or designee (Tier 2) – (reference self-employment policy). D. Supported Employment – in Developing an IPE that includes extended support services 1. Ensure participant is coded as MSD. a. Work with an individual to decide: (1) Services to be provided by VR, including supported employment services, (2) Expected extended support needs, and (3) Provider/Payor source for extended support services. b. If source of extended supports cannot be identified at the time of IPE development, the Supported Employment IPE may be implemented if there is a reasonable expectation that a provider/payor source for extended supports will become available upon completion of IPE services. (1) VR Counselor will inform the individual that substantial efforts will be made to assist in the identification of a provider/payor of extended support services prior to completion of IPE services but in the event no source can be identified upon completion of services, the case will be closed. (2) VR Counselor and the individual will jointly develop a Supported Employment IPE. E. The Supported Employment IPE will identify services to be provided by VR, including any expected extended support services and the source of extended support services. F. IPE Justification will be completed on the comprehensive assessment data page. G. Managing the Supported Employment IPE 1. If at any point during provision of IPE services it is determined that the individual is no longer in need of extended support services, VR counselor and the individual will amend the IPE plan type and associated supported employment services. 2. Once the individual obtains employment, VR Counselor will: a. Arrange for the provision of the agreed upon supported employment services which include, at a minimum, twice-monthly on-worksite monitoring or off-site meetings between the individual and VR staff or vendor to provide job training, coaching, observation, and/or follow-up services to reinforce and stabilize the employment; and b. Maintain monthly contact with the individual and/or supported employment service providers to discuss employment stability, progress, concerns, and the need for additional services or extension of Supported Employment services 123 5 beyond 24 months. c. VR Staff will document all contact and progress updates in the electronic case management system. d. If it is determined that the individual may need more than 24 months of supported employment services, Staff, individual, service providers, and employer (as necessary) will review the individual’s progress with the supported employment services that have been provided and determine if additional supported employment services can be expected to lead to stability in the employment outcome. (1) If VR Counselor, individual, service provider, and employer (as necessary) agree that additional services can be expected to lead to job stability, Staff and individual will agree upon the specific supported employment services that are needed beyond the 24-month timeframe, as well as the planned completion date of the services, not to exceed 3 months. (a) Details of extension will be documented in the case notes and the IPE will be amended as necessary. (b) If additional services are not expected to lead to job stability, (c) VR Counselor, individual, service provider, and employer (if available), will discuss next steps, including planned closure from VR. (d) When the individual has achieved stable employment, supported employment services provided by VR are considered complete and VR Counselor, the individual, and extended support services source will agree on the date of transition to extended support services. H. VR Counselor will document the agreed upon transition to extended support services date in the electronic case management system and the extended support services source will take over the provision and payment of extended support services as of that date. 1. VR staff will contact the individual or extended support services source at least once per month for the next 3 months to confirm that the individual continues to receive extended support services from the identified extended support services source and that the individual’s employment remains stable and appropriate for 90 days after transition to extended support services. 2. VR staff will close the individual’s case in accordance with closure policy of this manual. 124 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 412 Revision # Original Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: IPE – Amendments I. DESCRIPTION: The Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) is a ‘living document’ and changes to the IPE may occur at any time when agreed to by the individual and the VRNH counselor. These changes or amendments to the IPE provide for planned changes to be identified and recorded to assist the participant to reach an employment outcome. II. DEFINITIONS: Employment outcome: Full-time or, if appropriate, part-time competitive integrated employment, (including customized employment, self-employment, telecommuting, or business ownership), or supported employment that is consistent with an individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. III. POLICY: A. An Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) amendment shall be developed when, as a result of the annual review or at any other time, the IPE needs to be revised. B. All participants in an approved IPE are required to make consistent progress toward achieving their objectives and employment outcome. Consistent progress means the participant is: 1. Actively participating in their VR services; 2. Demonstrating consistent progress towards achieving the agreed upon objectives and employment goal; and 3. Maintaining contact with their VR Counselor. C. Objectives, services, and employment outcome will be amended, revised, or terminated if: 1. Acceptable progress toward achieving the objectives or employment outcome is not being made; 2. The employment outcome, services, or service providers needed to achieve the agreed upon employment outcome change; or 3. The objectives for the employment outcome change. D.

I. Introduction IPE Amendment procedures are designed to assure the IPE is updated to meet the ongoing planning needs of the IPE. II. IPE Amendment Process Parameters A. VRNH has two methods to implement an amendment to the IPE, the “New Plan” function and the “Amendment” function which is on the plan form. 1. The Amendment page is generated within the most recent Plan Start in the system. The amendment function allows for changes to the planned services. 2. The New Plan data page allows for changes in any of the plan elements, including services. B. An amendment is required in any of the following circumstances: 1. Change in an IPE employment goal or outcome: a. The job the participant got has a job title that is not within the same job group as the IPE employment goal(s) described in the IPE; or b. When the Employment Goal(s) in the existing IPE and the Job title in the Employment record are within the same job group in the electronic case management system, they are considered to match and an IPE amendment is not required. A job group is defined as an OES Job Title Category or as a “minor occupational group” in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System; or 2. The addition or deleting of a planned service; 3. A change in service provider. exception, interpreter services which are dependent on availability of an individual interpreter; 4. A substantial lengthening of time required to achieve an employment outcome. A substantial lengthening of time is defined as a lengthening of the IPE completion date by more than six months; or 5. A substantial change in the evaluation of progress. A substantial evaluation of progress change is defined as a change that increases the expectations placed on the participant to be seen as making satisfactory progress. 127 2 6. VR Counselor maintains regular contact with participant to monitor progress on the IPE. 7. If a change to the plan is identified VR Counselor and participant discuss the amendment and the changes that will be needed to the IPE including the reason for the amendment and how the amendment will impact services or the employment outcome. 8. VR Counselor documents discussion in case notes. 9. If all parties agree with the amendment, VR Counselor will: a.

DESCRIPTION: Case service statuses are used to track a participant’s progress through the VR process. Statuses included in this policy include Service, Service–Job Ready, Service-Employed, and Service-Interrupted. II. DEFINITIONS: There are no specific definitions to this policy. III. POLICY: A. Service: A case enters Service status upon initiation of the IPE: 1. During this status rehabilitation services are provided as identified in the IPE, and subsequent amendments. 2. Prior to the initiation of any service the case record will indicate: a. The service is substantial and necessary for the participant, i.e., the service will assist the participant in reaching their employment goal; b. The service is planned with the participant; and c. There has been a consideration of financial needs and comparable benefits, as appropriate. 3. VR staff shall monitor the provision of services. B. Service-Job Ready (Service –J) is used when the participant is ready for employment. 1. The participant is placed in this status when the participant has: a. Completed services to prepare them to achieve their employment goal and are ready to begin job search activities; or b. Has been referred to a community rehabilitation program provider (CRP) for job development activities. 2. During this status rehabilitation services are provided to assist the participant to obtain employment 3. Prior to the initiation of any service the case record will indicate: a.

A participant moves to Service-E status when they become employed while still receiving services to assure a successful employment outcome. 3. Participant shall provide verification of employment documentation. D. Service-Interrupted (Service-I) A case is considered to be interrupted when the Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) can no longer be continued and a new plan is unable to be developed. A case stays in interrupted status until a new plan has been written, the current plan is reactivated, or the file is ready to be closed. 1. The purpose of interrupted status is to recognize that a variety of situations may arise in the course of a rehabilitation program in which a temporary suspension of the program is warranted. In each case, VRNH must determine that the participant will be able to return to a rehabilitation program or a program of employment services following the resolution of the situation causing the interruption. 2. The major activity that takes place in this status is an attempt to develop a new plan or reactivate a previous plan in order to move the individual towards employment. This can include new or additional evaluations. 3. VR counselors will take an active role in trying to move cases back into an active status as rapidly as is feasible. 4. A plan will be developed listing the activities that will take place to return the file to an active status and entered as a case note. 5. If after 90 days the case is still considered to be interrupted, a new service interrupted plan will need to be created. 132 1 414.P Service Status Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Service Status Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group.

A participant is placed in Employed status when they have been prepared for, placed in, and begun employment, and no longer need VR services other than VR Counselor follow-up services to ensure stability of the employment. B. The participant must be in this employment status for a minimum of 90 days prior to being closed rehabilitated to insure the adequacy and stability of the employment in accordance with the needs and limitations of the individual. C. If it is identified additional services are needed, the case shall be moved back to an active service status. 138 1 415.P Employed Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2021 See corresponding policy: Employed Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the Employed status procedure is to provide adequate follow up support to ensure the participant is stable in their employment and no longer in need of VR services. II. Employed Process: A. Upon identifying that the participant is employed and no longer needs services other than VR Counselor follow up to ensure stability of employment, the VR Counselor reviews the job against the IPE goal. B. VR Counselor checks in with participant about the job and discusses how job meets the vocational goal and the needs of the participant for employment. 1.

If not obtained yet, VR Counselor continues follow up to obtain employment verification throughout the follow up period. H. If through ongoing contact it has been determined the participant is in need of additional services, staff should move the participant back to Service-E status. This is done through the removal of the stable date. VRC will send an activity due to the data unit to remove the stable date. I. If through ongoing contact it has been discovered that the participant lost their job, staff should enter an end date to the employment record in the electronic case management system. This will revert the participant back to Service status. Staff should not request removal of the stable date in this situation. J. VR staff attach related documentation in the electronic case management system. 140 1 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 416 Revision # 1 Implementation Date 7/1/2021 Page # 1 of 8 Last Reviewed/Update Date 9/1/2022 Policy Title: Program Exit – Closure of the Case Service Record I.

Special wage certification: A certificate issued to an employer under 14(c) of the Fail labor standards Act that authorizes payment of subminimum wages, wages less that the statutory minimum wage. III. POLICY: VRNH shall conduct required reviews on individuals who were closed due to an ineligibility determination based on significance of disability; in an extended employment setting; or under special certificate provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. A. Annual Review of Case Closure due to Severity of Disability 1. Individuals whose cases were closed ineligible due to the severity of their disability and based on a finding that the individual was incapable of benefiting from VRNH services in terms of an employment outcome shall be provided an opportunity for a review of that determination one year after case closure to assess whether their condition may have changed and they may now be capable of benefiting from services. 2.

I. Introduction The purpose of this procedure is to ensure fair and equitable follow-up reviews on cases where an individual has been determined either 1) ineligible due to severity of disability, 2) closed in extended employment, or 3) closed under special certificate provision. II. Annual Review of Case Closure due to Severity of Disability Process A. Central office will monitor cases closed too significantly disabled and notify the Regional office of former applicants and participants whose cases were closed ineligible one year previously because their disability was too severe. B. VR Counselor conducts a review against the closed case file to identify those individuals who do not require an annual review. For example, an annual review may not be required if: 1. The review process was explained to the participant at case closure, the participant did not desire the review, and this fact was summarized in the closure letter; 2. The individual is no longer in the state or cannot be located; or 3. The individual’s medical condition is rapidly progressive or terminal. C.

VR Counselor reviews the closed case file to identify those individuals who do not require a semi-annual review. For example, a semi-annual review may not be required if: 1. The review process was explained to the individual at case closure, the individual did not desire the review, and this fact was summarized in the closure letter, 2. The individual is no longer in the state or cannot be located, or 3. The individual’s medical condition is rapidly progressive or terminal. D.

Introduction The bureau requires individuals who have available resources to contribute, as appropriate, to the costs of services included in their IPE II. Determining Level of Participant Participation 1. During the development of the IPE, the counselor will work with the participant to complete the required financial needs assessment (FNA/FATF). a. FATF is used for financial participation for post-secondary expenses b. FNA is used for goods and services c. Both FNA and FATF are necessary in cases when nonexempt services are provided in addition to post-secondary expenses 2. Available resources will be included in the plan as participant costs. 3. The FNA/FATF are attached in the case management system with supporting documentation. VRC’s should ensure all signatures have been obtained prior to attaching. 4. Supporting documentation for exemption can include, but is not limited to: a. SSI/SSD award letter, b. public assistance budget, c. Other proof of public assistance (notice of decision or assistance group summary). This could be a screen shot from a case management system that includes participant name and name of public benefit receiving. 5. If the VRC is made aware of substantial changes in the finances of the individual, they should offer a reassessment of financial need. 6. Annually, the financial need assessment should be completed as part of the Annual Review process or, for training, prior to the beginning of each school year and must include updated documentation. 7. If financial need applies, the VRC should document in the case note accompanying the authorization that financial need exists, and the amount the participant is contributing toward the cost of the good or service, or that the participant has met the cost participation requirement. 166 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 503 Revision # Original Implementation Date 4/1/2021 Page # 1 of 4 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Use of Comparable Benefits I. DESCRIPTION: Comparable services and benefits are appropriate services or financial assistance from a source other than the bureau that will meet, in whole or in part, the cost of vocational rehabilitation services to be provided under an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE). II. DEFINITIONS: Comparable services and benefits: Services and benefits, including accommodations and auxiliary aids and services, that are— (A) Provided or paid for, in whole or in part, by other Federal, State, or local public agencies, by health insurance, or by employee benefits; (B) Available to the individual at the time needed to ensure the progress of the individual toward achieving the employment outcome in the individual's individualized plan for employment, and (C) Commensurate to the services that the individual would otherwise receive from the bureau. The service or benefit from another source must be similar in scope and quality to the service or benefit offered by the bureau to be considered \"commensurate\". For the purposes of this definition, comparable services and benefits do not include awards and scholarships based on merit. III. POLICY: The bureau must make maximum efforts to determine whether comparable services and benefits are available to an individual prior to paying for all vocational rehabilitation services, excluding only those services and circumstances listed as exemptions in this policy. The bureau staff and participants must continuously and actively seek comparable services and benefits in order to maximize the vocational rehabilitation resources available to individuals with disabilities. If an individual refuses to apply for or accept available comparable benefits, the bureau funds may not be substituted. 167 A. Prior to providing any vocational rehabilitation service, except those services listed in as exempt in part C below, to an eligible individual or to members of the individual's family, the Agency must determine whether comparable services and benefits exist under any other program and whether those services and benefits are available to the individual. This determination must not significantly interrupt or delay 1. The progress of the individual toward achieving the employment outcome identified in the individualized plan for employment; 2. An immediate job placement; or 3. The provision of vocational rehabilitation services to any individual who is determined to be at extreme medical risk, based on medical evidence provided by an appropriate qualified medical professional. B. Services identified as Exempt: The following vocational rehabilitation services are exempt from the requirement for determination of the availability of comparable services and benefits 1. Assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs. 2. Counseling and guidance, including information and support services to assist an individual in exercising informed choice. 3. Referral and other services to secure needed services from other agencies, including other components of the statewide workforce development system 4. Job-related services, including job search and placement assistance, job retention services, follow-up services, and follow-along services. 5. Rehabilitation technology, including telecommunications, sensory, and other technological aids and devices. C. In providing vocational rehabilitation services 1. The vocational rehabilitation counselor has an obligation to inform participants of known sources for comparable services and benefits and shall assist with application for these services when necessary. 2. Participants are required to apply for and accept comparable services and benefits to which they are entitled to receive before vocational rehabilitation funds can be expended, except as identified in part C of this policy. 3. If comparable services or benefits exist under any other program and are available to the individual at the time needed to ensure the progress of the individual toward achieving the employment outcome in the individual's individualized plan for employment, the bureau must use those comparable services or benefits to meet, in whole or part, the costs of the vocational rehabilitation services. 4. If comparable services or benefits exist under any other program, but are not available to the individual at the time needed to ensure the progress of the individual toward achieving the employment outcome specified in the individualized plan for employment, the bureau must provide vocational rehabilitation services until those comparable services and benefits become available. 168 10 5. The consideration of comparable services and benefits shall be documented in the participant's case record and shall include sources of assistance considered, whether the participant applied, acceptable reasons for failure to apply, outcome of application, and basis for the decision to expend vocational rehabilitation funds for services. 6. Student loan default: If a participant is in default of a student loan, financial aid, including Pell, will not be available to the individual. the bureau is prohibited from paying for any training or related services at a post-secondary program which is eligible for federal assistance such as Pell funds (including, but not limited to, colleges and business and trade schools) for an individual who owes a refund on a grant or is in default of a student loan, unless the individual makes maximum effort to resolve the default. Maximum effort means that the participant has worked out a satisfactory repayment plan with the lending institution or grantor and has re-established eligibility for financial aid. D. If a public entity (other than the bureau) is obligated under Federal law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, section 504 of the Act, or section 188 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act) or State law, or assigned responsibility under State policy or an interagency agreement, to provide or pay for any services considered to be vocational rehabilitation services (e.g., interpreter services), and, if appropriate, accommodations or auxiliary aids and services other than those services listed in part C, 1-6 above, the public entity must fulfill that obligation or responsibility through— 1. The terms of the interagency agreement or other requirements of this section; 2. Providing or paying for the service directly or by contract; or 3. Other arrangement. E. When another comparable benefit source has primary responsibility for providing the needed service, vocational rehabilitation has responsibility to apply those funds prior to expenditure of any vr funds. If a public entity other than the bureau fails to provide or pay for vocational rehabilitation services, and, if appropriate, accommodations or auxiliary aids and services for an eligible individual as established, the bureau must provide or pay for those services to the individual. F. Counselor responsibility: In making maximum effort to secure comparable benefits prior to using vocational rehabilitation funds, counselors must: 1. acquire at least general knowledge about the nature of services available from other sources, their eligibility criteria, and the application and appeals process; 2. explore with the individual all possible sources of comparable benefits and assess, through discussion with the participant, the appropriateness of pursuing specific benefits or services and the availability of such benefits; 3. document in the case record the participant’s application for benefits or the reasons the bureau funds are being used in place of benefits; and 4. monitor the application of benefits and assist the individual, if necessary 169 11 G. Participant Responsibility: Participants must illustrate cooperation in exploring the availability of and securing comparable benefits available to them. To do this they must: 1. Applying in a timely manner for all comparable benefits and services which are appropriate, with counselor assistance if necessary; 2. Accepting and use comparable benefits and services when available; and 3. Informing the bureau counselor of the availability and status of comparable benefit, status of any application and the receipt or denial of any comparable benefit. 170 17 503.P Comparable Services and Benefits Procedure Revision date: Original 4/1/2022 See corresponding policy: Use of Comparable Benefits Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for the bureau staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The required pursuit of comparable benefits is limited to benefits available from federal, State and local grant sources, health insurance and employee benefit programs that are applicable to services required for the successful completion of the IPE. II. Sources of Comparable Benefits A. VRC pursues comparable benefits from sources such as 1. Federal, State or local public agencies. Examples would include Medicaid, Veteran's Benefits, Pell, reduced fare public transportation for individuals with disabilities, publicly funded para- transit services, etc. 2. Health insurance, from any source. 3. Employers. Specific examples of comparable benefits that may be offered by an employer include, but are not limited to: tuition assistance, transportation, training courses and health insurance benefits. B. Private scholarships or contributions from non-governmental sources are not comparable benefits under federal regulations. However, it is still appropriate to ask a participant if they are in receipt of such benefits. The VRC should educate the participant of the availability of these scholarships and awards that may be able to assist with costs, but the participant is not required to apply for them. III. Process A. VRC advises participant of their cooperative responsibility to explore and secure comparable benefits as soon in the IPE development process as possible. This will ensure that comparable benefits are available at the time services are initiated. 171 17 1. It is the VRC responsibility to have and/or acquire at least general knowledge about the nature of services available from other sources, their eligibility criteria, and the application and appeals process 2. This step applies to any subsequent amendment to the IPE. B. VRC explores with the individual all possible sources of comparable benefits and assesses, through discussion with the participant, the appropriateness of pursuing specific benefits or services and the availability of such benefits; C. VRC documents in the case record the participant’s application for benefits or the reasons the bureau funds are being used in place of benefits to include interruption of services, delay imminent loss of job placement or medical risk. D. VRC monitors the application of benefits and assist the individual, if necessary IV. Case Recording: VRC records in case notes the identification of sources that were considered and progress toward obtaining the comparable benefit. The case record should also include the following: A. To the extent possible, details of the comparable benefit available to the individual, including the provider, the receipt or denial of benefits, and the amounts of any benefits to be received by the individual. Attach any applicable documentation if provided such as letter from an insurance company noting benefit or limits to benefits, FATF B. On the IPE, document the amount of the comparable benefit, as it applies to planned service. 1. If there is no comparable benefit available to reduce the cost of the service, then the amount to enter in the comparable benefit field in the case management system is 0 and none is selected. 2. If there is a known comparable benefit, the amount of that known benefit must be entered in the comparable benefit field. 3. If there is a possible comparable benefit, or a known comparable benefit but the specific dollar value of that is unknown at the time the IPE is being prepared, the comparable benefit field must include reasonable estimate C. On the authorization, document the type of comparable benefit used in part for the services. If there are no comparable benefits used document none. 172 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 504 Revision # Original Implementation Date 4/1/2021 Page # 1 of 2 Last Reviewed/Update Date 7/1/2023 Waiver: Exception to Bureau Policy I.

Exception: Exclusion from a policy as a result of individualized circumstances Waiver: To refrain from applying or enforcing a specific policy; the act or instance of providing an exception to policy; or documentation recording the waiving of a specified policy III. POLICY: The bureau has a process in place to evaluate the participant’s individual situation and to determine whether the cost, duration limits, or specific policies established in the bureau’s policy would in effect deny the participant access to necessary services or pose undue hardships on an individual. This exception, or waiver, process is established to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of an individual when necessary to achieve an employment outcome. A. The bureau may not establish policies or fee schedules that place any arbitrary limit on the nature and scope of services to be provided to the individual to achieve an employment outcome. The bureau has a waiver process that can be utilized when a participant requires services and/or supports that are outside the scope of written policies, procedures, and fee schedules. The Waiver Request Form is used to request a review and potential waiver in individual circumstances. B. Exceptions to the policies concerning the provision of services must be approved by the Director or designee. This includes requests to exceed financial contribution maximums, timeframe limits, and other service selection criteria as outlined in policy. C. Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRC) work with the individual to complete a full exploration of comparable benefits, ability to participate financially and/or other supports. Once all alternatives have been explored, the participant and VRC may request a waiver. D. Participants shall be informed of the waiver process as part of explaining services, financial contribution and comparable benefits. A participant may request a waiver with or without the support of the VRC. E. Once a waiver request is identified the Waiver Request Form must be used to document the waiver request. 173 F. If a waiver is not approved, the participant will be advised of rights and appeals options, including the availability of Client Assistance Program (CAP). G. The bureau does not have authority to grant waivers that are contrary to any state or federal laws, rules, or regulation. 174 504.P Waiver Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2023 See corresponding policy: Exception to Bureau Policy Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for bureau staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. Introduction The purpose of the waiver procedure is to ensure fair and equitable service provision and consistent processes for request and review of all requests to waive policy. II. Procedure PROCEDURE A. As part of explaining services, financial contribution, and comparable benefits, the VRC explains the waiver policy. B. When the VRC becomes aware of the individual's extenuating circumstances or their request for a waiver, the VRC will inform the individual of the procedure to request an exception, or waiver to policy. 1. The VRC reviews the policy the participant is asking to be waived with the participant to assure they are aware of and understand the policy. 2. If the participant chooses to pursue a waiver of policy, the waiver request form is completed either in conjunction with the counselor or the participant may complete it on their own. 3. VRC reviews completed waiver request form and attaches it in the case management system, if not generated as a case note through waiver request form letter template. 4. VRC assures all necessary documentation is on file and completes a case note indicating their support or non-support of the waiver request with rationale for their support or non-support. 5. VRC requests supervisor review of the waiver request through an activity due (AD) titled Waiver Request from the waiver request case note. The activity due will stay in pending status until closed by the Director or designee. 6. The Supervisor reviews the waiver request to determine any outstanding information items, and if incomplete returns request to VRC to ensure all necessary information is included. 175 7. Once waiver request is complete supervisor writes a case note indicating their determination to support or not support the request, rationale, and any other information regarding their decision. 8. Supervisor requests Director or designee review by summarizing their stance on waiver and adding them to the existing activity due. 9. The Director or designee reviews the waiver request and writes a case note indicating their determination to support or not support the request. a. If the request is not supported, rationale will be provided and documented in a letter in the case management system to be sent to the participant by the regional office. b. If the request is supported, the director or designee has the opportunity to provide additional information or rationale for their support. 10. Director or designee notifies the VRC through an activity due of the decision from the waiver request decision case note and ensures the initial AD is completed. 11. VRC contacts the participant, discusses the decision and next steps, and documents this discussion in case notes. 12. In instances where the waiver is not approved, the VRC will provide further follow- up by mailing the letter written by the Director or designee documenting the decision and the participant’s right to appeal if the participant is not in agreement with the decision. 176 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 505 Revision # Original Implementation Date 9/1/2022 Page # 1 of 3 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Assessment services I.

Provision of Interpreter Services A. From initial contact throughout the rehabilitation process the vocational rehabilitation counselor (VRC) shall engage the individual in determining their preferred mode of communication apprising them of their right to have a qualified interpreter present at meetings. 1. The key to determining effective communication is to consider the nature, length, complexity, and context of the communication along with individual’s preferred mode of communication.

Bureau staff with sign language skills communicating with participants does not constitute provision of a qualified interpreter service. VRCs may choose to arrange for a qualified interpreter in providing counseling or vocational information.

Because of the mental and physical fatigue brought on by the continuous interpreting process, it may be necessary to provide two or more interpreters and/or recess periods for assignments extending more than 2 hours. 2. Since the background, education, language levels, and communication methods of participants who rely on manual communication or oral interpretation vary, the interpreter shall be carefully matched to the individual's communication mode. Agencies that provide interpreter services in a region generally strive to match the interpreter with the known communication method of the participant. While some individuals who rely on manual communication or oral interpreting may be able to communicate by writing or lip reading for short periods of time and in low stress situations, interpreters shall be provided for more formal or demanding situations such as for vocational counseling, throughout a training program, during the initial training on the job, etc., unless the individual requests that an interpreter not be provided. 197 E.

I. Introduction II. Home Modification process A. When the VRC and participant identify that home modification is a potential service to be included in the IPE, the case is reviewed by the Regional Leader and the Home Modification Coordinator. (Coordinator) 1. Review is completed to assure that the home modifications requested are necessary to support the participant in employment B. At the direction of the Coordinator, the Home Modification Consultant (HMC) will meet with the VRC and the participant to discuss the areas of the residence that are not fully accessible and are currently causing a barrier to employment. Best practice is to include the Regional Leader in this consultation. If appropriate they will visit the residence and inspect the areas of concern to assess the accessibility needs of the participant C. The HMC provides an initial recommendation report detailing the potential needs and estimated costs. 1. If experts in adaptive equipment or disabilities need to be brought in, 2. the Contractor may subcontract with these entities only after receiving written authorization. 3. Note: At any point in the modification process nothing contained in the specifications or drawings shall be construed as creating any contractual relationship between any subcontractor and the State D. The Coordinator, RL, and VRC use the following outline (5-6) to direct the overview and supervision of the project and direct the authorization and payment of services: 1. Initial report is reviewed by the Coordination, RL, and VRC. a. If all parties agree that the services are reasonable and necessary, the HMC will be directed to prepare a full Scope of Work Report and prepare the job for bid. b. The Scope of Work Report articulates the dimensions and measurements of the project, materials, all pertinent building permits, and outcomes necessary for a Contractor to submit a proposal to complete the proposed modification. The Scope 220 22 of Work Report is to include any applicable warranty information. A detailed deliverable-based schedule outlining important deadlines and deliverables will be included in the Scope of Work Report. Modifications are subject to industry standards for safety, liability, and durability as referenced in building codes, materials, and manuals. 2. Invitation for Bid or Written Quotes – Dependent of the scope of services and at the direction of the Coordinator the HMC prepares and procures written quotes for each aspect of the build. Bids and quotes should be procured using industry standards but will contain no fewer than three quotes for any goods over five hundred ($500) dollars or labor over one thousand ($1,000) dollars. If three quotes are unable to be obtained for the previously mentioned items, a sole source justification will first need to be approved by the Coordinator. The HMC will provide the State with a summary of the quotes received including all references checks and necessary insurance as needed. The Coordinator will review the quotes and Scope of Work from the HMC for approval. 3. General Contracting - If the Scope of Work as well as the Bids and Quotes obtained are approved by the Coordinator, the HMC will act as the General Contractor for the entire build subcontracting with vendors to provide the services needed to complete the project in an effective and efficient method. General Contractor services include but are not limited to: a. Management and coordination of the entire project Site surveying b. Provision of all necessary material, labor, equipment, and services for the entire project c. Hiring and vetting all subcontractors while supervising the work they complete d. Applying for building permits Securing the property Managing all personnel on site e. Properly disposing or recycling of construction waste, ensuring daily clean up and debris caused by the construction operation Monitoring schedules and maintaining accurate records f.

Materials – While acting as the General Contractor the HMC will procure all necessary materials, labor, equipment, and services through written Purchase Order with the State. Material and product warranties shall be passed through to the owner of the residence. The HMC and any subcontractors shall not require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to their health or safety as determined by construction safety and health standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States Department of Labor, which standards include, by reference, the established Federal Safety and Health Regulations for Construction. The Contractor shall post information to the Davis-Bacon and related Acts (DBRA) which require the HMC and subcontractors to pay locally prevailing wages to laborers and mechanics employed on certain federal and federally assisted construction projects. The Davis-Bacon Act applies to contractors and subcontractors performing work on contracts in excess of $2,000 for construction. This must be posted in a prominent and accessible place where it may be easily seen by workers. The applicable wage determination must be similarly posted. 221 22 5. Warranty - The HMC shall warranty all work, including work completed by subcontractors for a period of no less than a period of one (1) year to be agreed upon with all parties in the Scope of Work. Any work or materials found by the State to be defective or not in compliance with the plans and specifications shall be replaced at no cost to the State during the warranty period. The State shall require correction of defective work or damages to any part of a building or its appurtenances, at no charge when caused by the HMC’s employees, subcontractors, equipment, or supplies. Upon failure of the HMC to proceed promptly with the necessary corrections, the State may withhold payments to the Contractor of any amount necessary to correct all defective work or damage. Workmanship disputes between owner and HMC shall be brought to the attention of the Coordinator for mediation. All complaints will be addressed prior to payment. 6. Change Requests - Prior to any change of scope of work a written change order will need to be submitted to the State and no work shall commence until an amended written authorization or Purchase Order. This can only occur once the homeo wn er and Coordinator all agree on any changes. The request must detail the nature of the change including any impact on cost and any effect on the schedule. E. VRC maintains contact with the participant throughout the process to assure progress is consistent with the participants understanding and agreement. 222 22 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 521 Revision # Original Implementation Date 4/1/2021 Page # 1 of 4 Last Reviewed/Update Date None (a) Vehicle Modification I.

Introduction The bureau's procedure on vehicle modification is intended to ensure the proper steps are taken when a participant requires a vehicle modification and the vehicle modification process is consistent for all participants. Vehicle Modification Process: Throughout the process the VR Counselor (VRC) maintains contact with the participant to coordinate services; works with the Regional Leader (RL) and Vehicle Modification Liaison (VML) to obtain required approvals; and generates authorizations for service. Note: At any stage of the process, if bureau staff reviewing the case does not approve the vehicle modification, they will document the decision in the case record, and the VRC will notify the participant of the decision, including the rationale for the decision and the process to appeal, including the availability of the Client Assistance Program. 1. The VRC identifies that vehicle modification may be necessary to remove impairment related transportation barriers, in order to meet a participant’s employment outcome. The VRC confirms the following: a. The participant is competitively employed or is within a year of employment. b. the participant does not own another vehicle which would meet transportation needs, and c. The participant’s disability prevents the use of any other reasonable transportation alternative (public transportation, family member, etc.) 2. The VRC notifies RL of a potential vehicle modification for planning purposes. 3. The VRC and the participant discuss vehicle modification policy and process. The VRC will document this discussion as a case note. The discussion will include a. The transportation needs as either the driver or passenger, b. vehicle availability, and condition c. Policy requirements specific to the participant's circumstances. d. The steps and the timeline e. Any other factors that may influence the success or progress of the modification, 227 22 such as; 1) Other rehabilitation technology, including wheelchair. Assess the following: (a) Condition of the technology (b) Age and Projected remaining lifespan (will it need to be replaced within 3 years) (c) Availability for the evaluation 2) Supplemental durable medical equipment or other devices needed to operate the RT, e.g., SmartDrive or other types of hardware for a wheelchair a. Progression of Disability: Assess whether the disability is stable or progressive. If there is a question of stability of the disability, then request documentation from a medical doctor regarding the progression of the participant’s condition and consult with VMC. 4. The VRC begins to complete the bureau Vehicle Modification Participant Checklist and uses this to guide the process. 5. Participant and VRC choose the vendor for the driver’s evaluation. When providing the participant with the vendor options for a driver’s evaluation, it is important to know the type of modification(s) that are needed and which vendor(s) have the proper vehicle and equipment to provide the evaluation. The following points need to be considered when making this decision: a. Is the modification structural or nonstructural b. Will the vendor be able to provide the necessary evaluation if a high tech evaluation is needed c. Will the vendor need to rent a high tech van from an approved vendor to perform the evaluation. d. Is the participant licensed to drive in New Hampshire e. Is it likely that the participant will require additional training on their newly modified vehicle f. Can the participant travel to the evaluation site 6. VRC completes the referral for a driver’s evaluation a. Refer participant for evaluation b.

Passes Inspection: the report and invoice will be forwarded to the VRC and Regional Office Rehabilitation Technician for payment. b. Passes Inspection, but Needs Correction: The VML will contact the VRC to review these items and to discuss next steps. If it is determined that the correction(s) require an equipment change, an updated quote will be requested from the vehicle modification vendor. Depending upon the equipment needed, the Driving Evaluator may be required to submit an amended evaluation to include the new equipment. This amended evaluation does not need to be reviewed by the VMC. i. The VMC will indicate on the final report if re-inspection is needed following the modifications being corrected. ii. If an equipment change is needed, the VML will forward the updated quote with explanation to the Director or designee for approval. c. Not Recommended at this Time for Acceptance (must be re- inspected): In this case, the VML and VMC will discuss what the next steps will be in order to ensure that the 231 10 modifications are properly completed by the vendor and that the participant receives their vehicle in a timely manner.

DESCRIPTION: This policy addresses specific requirements related to the choice of pursuing self- employment/business ownership as part of an employment goal. Self-employment, or working for oneself, is identified as a potential way a participant can achieve their employment. Self- employment involves business ownership and responsibility for all business operations, including management (even if the participant hires, contracts out, or has natural supports to perform some business functions). II. DEFINITIONS: Self-employment: is defined as any work that is self-initiated and does not occur solely at the direction and compensation of another. Business ownership and self-employment involve selling or providing goods and services to others for a profit. A business is an organization, which applies human resources, products or services, and organizational resources in order to make a profit. Self-employment means earning income directly from one’s own trade or profession, rather than a salary from an employer. An independent contractor, who provides services to another business for a fee rather than a salary, is a form of self-employment. Self-employment/business ownership in itself is not an employment outcome. The type of business, the nature of the self-employment is an integral part of this selection. A business must be about something, it must provide some specific goods or services. Selection of a specific business is part of the selection of a self-employment/business outcome. Both the type of occupation/business and the objective to be self-employed need to be considered in the process of assessment and approval of the employment outcome. Note: Home-based businesses should not be confused with home-based employment. If an individual’s home is the location for performing job duties as an employee, such as telecommuting, and the individual is working for someone else, the person is not ‘self-employed.’ Business ownership is defined as an individual operating and owning at least 51% of the business enterprise. Review Business Consultant: A business consultant who reviews the plan to provide an evaluative review of the business plan or proposal. 233 10 An Evaluative Review of the business plan or business proposal is a review by an independent, impartial business consultant to assess the- • viability of the business and likelihood of success, • likelihood of the participant achieving the projected net income stated in the plan, and • identification of weaknesses that need to be addressed. Hobby is defined as a spare-time recreational pursuit. A hobby is an activity for which there is not an expectation of profit. Passive ownership - Passive business ownership involves purchasing an ownership interest in a business and deriving a dividend income from the profit of the business as a result of the ownership of the interest, rather than actively managing the business operations and producing income from one’s efforts. Passive business ownership is more of an investment and is not considered to be an employment outcome. Self-employment costs: The cost of starting the business as addressed in the business plan. Self- employment costs do not include training, business plan development, assistive technology, or disability related modifications to the job site or vehicle. Self Sufficiency is defined as needing no supplemental income from public sources such as SSI, SSDI and TANF. Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA), as determined by the Social Security Administration, can be an indicator of self-sufficiency. A person may continue to receive public benefits such as food stamps and MEAD and be considered self-sufficient. Speculative Businesses are defined as ventures that involve a high degree of risk in hopes to profit from anticipated activities such as price movement. Examples include gambling and trading in commodities, bonds, equities and currencies, and other ventures where the expectation is to make quick and large gains. Startup costs: means expenses for- • equipment for the business, improving a worksite to suit the business and licenses needed to open a business; • insurance deposits for such things as rent and utilities, payment of rent and utilities for a maximum of six (6) months; and • initial stock and supplies as defined below: Initial stocks and supplies are further described: • “Initial Stock” – The initial inventory of merchandise or goods a business sells, or prepares for resale, either wholesale or retail. The initial stock should be limited to the amount necessary for the participant to open his/her place of business and to carry the business through the first month of operation. • “Supplies” – Those items used on the premises and necessary to carry out the day-to-day operations of the business. Under normal conditions, initial supplies would be those needed during the first month of operation of the business. The business plan should contain documentation to show how the amount was determined. Supplemental income is defined as income at the level that allows the continuance of public 234 10 financial support from public sources such as SSI, SSDI, and TANF. (Note: Continuance of public benefits such as food stamps and MEAD can be considered as self-sufficiency.) Telecommuting means to work at home by use of an electronic linkup with a central office. An individual who telecommutes is still an employee, even though performing work functions at home. Unprofitable business operation - a business which does not generate a profit can become a substantial economic liability. By definition, a business must produce a profit. If the business does not generate enough income to meet its expenses, including the cost of the owner’s time and efforts, there is usually no advantage to business ownership III. POLICY: The bureau can support a participant interested in starting their own business or help them maintain or expand their existing business. Self-employment is one of the occupational alternatives which may be considered in the wide array of employment options available to a person. The successful self-employment enterprise requires an array of skills and abilities, including organization, business and financial management, marketing and other talents, as well as, knowledge and expertise in the goods or services being produced. It is essential that the participant is well informed of potential risks, and efforts are made to minimize those risks. A. Self-employment is not a vocational goal in and of itself. The vocational goal is the occupation identified through the comprehensive assessment that identifies the occupation the participant plan to achieve as defined by a standard occupational code (SOC). B. As with other employment outcomes supported by the bureau, the self-employment outcome must reflect the individual’s career interest and informed choice to the extent that those factors are consistent with the individual’s unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, interests, abilities and capabilities. C. The bureau’s support of an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) that includes a self- employment outcome is based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the viability of the business plan or proposal, the financial resources available other than the bureau, the information gathered through the assessment process, and the vocational rehabilitation counselor’s recommendation. D. Under the bureau, self-employment: 1. Means the participant manages, operates, and owns at least 51% of the business enterprise and is not considered an employee of another individual, business, or organization; 2. Exists when the service or product is actively marketed to potential customers 3. Includes home-based businesses and telecommuting businesses (if no taxes are withheld by an employer); and 4. Includes sole-proprietorships or limited liability companies E. Self-employment will only be considered when the participant can demonstrate having significant knowledge and skill required for their self-employment venture. F. To be successful, a bureau/participant partnership to create a self-employment venture must 235 10 show: 1. a significant commitment of participant time and personal or family resources to the new venture, 2. a well thought out, realistic first-year business plan or proposal that includes the best possible estimate of revenues and expenses, 3. plan evaluation by an outside expert, when necessary, and 4. acknowledgement that the guidelines utilized by bureau personnel and the participant to consider, evaluate, plan, and implement a self-employment rehabilitation are a multi- stage process that may require extended time to complete. G. Parameters of Business/Self-Employment Endeavors 1. A wide spectrum of business ventures may be considered for self-employment. Businesses supported by bureau must: a. Comply with all relevant state, federal and local laws, codes, regulations and licensing requirements; b. Involve majority ownership and management of the business by the participant served by the agency; c. For supported business enterprise, involve majority ownership and participation in a core business function by the individual served with management of the business by an identified support person(s); d. Be established in an integrated, community work setting; e. Not involve speculative activities, i.e., engagement in risky business deals on the chance of large, quick profits; and f. Be designed to be the major source of income for the individuals. In the case of Tier 1 proposal, venture may be designed as a supplemental source of income for the individual. 2. Disallowed Businesses: bureau does not support businesses involving: a. Passive ownership, b. Speculative ventures, c. Unprofitable business ventures, d. Income opportunities based solely or primarily on recruiting salespeople to continue building the enterprise (commonly known as Ponzi or pyramid schemes), e. Enterprises prohibited by law or that sell products prohibited by law, or f. Hobbies. H. Funding: 1. Tier 1 and Tier 2: The bureau has two processes or levels of support for meeting the self- employment goals of participants. The first level (Tier 1) applies to self-employment plans that are micro-enterprise in nature and require minimal approval processes. The second level (Tier 2) applies to larger self-employment plans that involve the participant operating a business. These ventures involve a more highly critical analysis and approval by the bureau staff and an objective outside consultant. The bureau may provide up to $4,000 for micro-enterprise ventures and up to $12,000 for ventures intended to lead to self-sufficiency. Costs should be outlined before dollar amounts to be provided by the bureau are discussed. The bureau’s allowable contribution shall not be viewed as an ‘automatic grant’ and is subject to financial need and comparable benefit requirements. a. Tier 1 Self-employment Plan: 236 10 (1) Tier 1 – support of Micro-enterprise development is a plan where the participant is a business owner and/or independent contractor and: (a) is working for themselves, but delivering a service to other businesses and customers; (b) The participant can demonstrate the relationship with customers through a contract and/or generated or anticipated income to demonstrate financial feasibility of the business; (2) Tier 1 plans can also be used in situations where the participant is not expecting to be self-sufficient through the self-employment venture alone. This type of plan is for a person who is supplementing an existing lifestyle. Examples include a person living in a rural/remote area who needs a cash income to supplement their lifestyle; a person who can only work part-time and needs to supplement the family income; or a person who wishes to work with the continuation of public benefits such as SSI, SSDI and TANF. (3) In either situation the overall maximum bureau support of the Tier 1 plan is not to exceed $4,000. b. Tier 2 Self-employment Plan: The purpose of a Tier 2 Self-Employment plan is to assist an individual through the development and operation of a small business. In the end, the business operations should result in the participant becoming self- sufficient and self-supporting. Unlike a Tier 1 plan, a Tier 2 plan is for a person who is committed to being financially independent and desires to operate a business and assume all the risks that it entails as their method for becoming financially independent. Therefore, the Tier 2 plan should not be used for someone who is planning to supplement a lifestyle or who is not planning to give up such financial supports as may be provided by other governmental programs. The bureau should not be the sole funding source for a Tier 2 Plan. It is expected that individuals pursuing Tier 2 plans will demonstrate the ability for income resources to continue the business after the implementation of initial bureau support. 2. Comparable Benefits: The participant must make application for all available comparable services, such as micro enterprise grants, Small Business Administration assistance, and Individual Development Accounts. For experienced help in developing a business plan and other business support, participants can use comparable benefits that are available from: a. Some workforce development one-stop centers, b. The Small Business Administration, c. Small Business Development Centers, and d. Similar organizations. 3. Financial need: Subject to financial need requirements, the participant should contribute toward the cost of the planned services to the maximum of their abilities 4. Customer Loan - If the participant is pursuing a loan from a lending institution or other source and the funds are critical to the business start-up, the participant must provide- a. Documentation of the loan application, and a. Documented assessment from the lending institution or other source of the likelihood of loan approval before the expenditure of VR funds on the business I. Process: If self-employment is to be the placement of choice, the decision needs to be made 237 10 as early as possible in the rehabilitation process. Active participation by both the rehabilitation counselor and the participant are extremely critical in this decision. Owing to the very challenging nature of self-employment both the advantages and disadvantages should be carefully considered. Self-employment shall be consistent with the participant’s strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. Because of the demands, responsibility, and risk inherent in owning a small business, structured and extensive assessment and planning are required in order to provide the individual with information needed to make decisions which will lead to successful employment outcomes. To assure this, prior to the development of an Individualized Plan for Employment that includes self-employment/business ownership as part of the vocational goal, the following steps need to be completed as part of the Comprehensive Assessment: 1. Discussion and assessment: When a participant states interest in self-employment, the counselor and the participant need to first carefully consider what is involved in operating a business and consider whether the participant has the strengths, abilities, and resources necessary to be successful in such a venture. At this time, the counselor must discuss the business idea with the participant including the advantages and disadvantages of self-employment. This step also includes evaluating the individual’s entrepreneurial potential. A person who wants to begin a business should take responsibility for determining if they have the attributes necessary to operate a successful business. Participants may take part in a variety of self-assessment activities which can include standardized business assessments, interviewing business owners, or other creative means of assessing their own business potential. The Counselor will have a variety of material for the participant to use to explore their own suitability for being self-employed. The person should examine their own expertise, commitment and persistence, and other factors relevant to self-employment. Counselor judgment and data gathered will play important roles in this process since no single factor can determine whether a person will succeed at a business. Before proceeding to the next step, the counselor and participant will analyze the assessment and other related documentation to demonstrate that the individual has the personal ability to succeed in small business ownership. 2. Exploration: Once it has been determined that the individual has the personal ability to succeed in small business ownership, the other question is whether the business under consideration is viable. Included in this exploration phase is the identification of sources for self-employment training, education, business plan development and support. This step expands on the evaluation of the individual’s entrepreneurial potential and includes evaluating the feasibility of the proposed business. a. Feasibility Study: The participant completes an outline of the proposed business plan utilizing the bureau self-employment Checklist. The VR counselor can assist the participant in completing the checklist or advise the participant of other resources that can assist them. The VR counselor and participant then jointly review and critically analyze the completed information. The VR counselor assists the participant in carefully analyzing the financial feasibility and viability of the proposed self-employment venture as well as the participant’s skills, preparedness, aptitude, financial status, and other abilities necessary for starting and operating the enterprise. An important issue is the participant’s access to capital. The feasibility study should 238 10 show the participant has adequate access to capital through other resources than bureau funding. In order to move to the next step, the feasibility study should show the participant has the ability to perform and/or to manage the core functions of the business to actually produce the product or service to a profitable level. b. When the checklist is complete, the VR counselor and participant review it to determine whether self-employment still appears to be a viable option for the participant after looking at more detailed information. 3. Proposal developed: After assessment of the individual and the proposed business the individual is required to complete a business plan or proposal. a. Tier 1 cases: The individual does not need to submit a complete business plan. Tier 1 submissions require a description and proposal of the self-employment venture that is clear and provides adequate information for the bureau to understand and approve the venture and the expenditures. Tier 1 proposals include: (1) Description of the proposed self-employment/business, (2) Reasons for wanting to establish an enterprise where there is a high risk of failure, rather than prepare for and/or find employment for a wage or salary, (3) A list of past training or work experience that qualifies the individuals to manage and operate the proposed enterprise, (4) Evidence of the need for the proposed service or business in the community, (5) Evidence and analysis of how the price of merchandise and charge for services are competitive and make a fair profit, (6) Description of plans and arrangements for merchandising, marketing, business development, advertising and for getting the cooperation and interest of the community in the enterprise, (7) Description of arrangements to set up and maintain accounting records for the business, (8) Estimated total amount of money needed to start the business and the proposed source for the funds, e.g., participant, bureau (up to $4,000), and (9) Financial estimate of first 12 months of operation including estimated expenses, income, profit, taxes, income after taxes, and other money income from sources other than business (i.e., Social Security, spouse’s wages, retirement pensions, etc.). b. Tier 2 cases: Except as noted in bureau Policy for Tier 1 plans all self-employment ventures require the development of a business plan prior to approval of bureau support for the business/self-employment. If the VR counselor and participant jointly conclude that it is appropriate to proceed with the self-employment option, a detailed business plan is then developed. The participant is expected to develop the business plan based on realistic market information collected from thorough research, as well as other pertinent information. The purpose of this plan is to assure that information regarding all relevant facets of the proposed business venture, and the VR participant’s goals and abilities are considered in sufficient detail. This will ensure that the VR counselor and participant employ a recognized business planning process to determine whether the venture’s potential for success outweighs possible risks or liabilities, and whether it meets criteria to advance to the next stage of VR self-employment planning process. 239 10 The Business plan should include, at a minimum, the required elements identified in bureau policy. In the event the participant needs additional assistance to complete their own business plan, the VR counselor can help the participant seek out and obtain assistance from qualified sources. 4. Approval: The decision to use bureau funds to support a business start-up will be based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to total start-up costs, viability of the business plan, potential for other financial sources and Counselor judgment. a. Tier 1 approval process: (1) Once the participant’s business proposal is completed, the VR counselor reviews it. If the counselor determines that the venture warrants bureau support, the proposal is presented and recommended by the VR counselor and the participant to the Regional Leader for initial review. (2) The Regional Leader reviews the proposal and the case file for completeness in accordance with bureau policy and if complete Supervisor approves proposal and documents in case record. b. Tier 2 approval process: (1) Once the participant’s business plan is completed, the VR counselor reviews it. If the counselor determines that the business plan is complete and the venture warrants bureau support, the business plan shall be presented and recommended by the VR counselor and the participant to the Regional Leader for initial review. (2) The Regional Leader reviews the business plan and the case file for completeness in accordance with bureau policy and forwards the business plan to the Review Business Consultant (3) The Review Business Consultant reviews the business plan for and provides feedback to the Counselor and the Regional Leader regarding the viability of the business and likelihood of success; the likelihood of the participant achieving the projected net income stated in the plan; and the identification of weaknesses that need to be addressed. (4) Based on the Review Business Consultant’s recommendation the Regional Leaders forwards the business plan to the Director (or the Director’s Designee) with recommendation. Any deficiencies must be corrected prior to the business plan being submitted to the Director (or Director’s Designee). (5) The Director (or Director’s Designee) reviews the plan, and the business consultant recommendation and makes the decision on approval of support for self-employment services. 5. Decision not to continue: If it is determined that self-employment is not a reasonably attainable option for the participant at any point throughout the process, the VR counselor should provide counseling and guidance to assist the participant in understanding the reasons for this determination. They will then work together to identify a new vocational goal. If the determination not to continue is based on an agency decision not to approve the proposed self-employment venture, the counselor will provide the participant in writing with the rationale for the decision and notice of the appeal process and of the availability of the Client Assistance Program. 240 10 J. Required Elements of the Business Plan (Tier 2): A business plan is an important tool in developing and managing a small business. The business plan explains the major concepts of starting and managing a small business including financial, marketing, managing, growth, and other related factors. The business plan shall consist of the following components: 1. Professional Profile: A description of personal experience and related factors that would make this participant successful in a self-employment setting. This should also incorporate barriers/impediments and the plan to overcome these through a self-employment approach. Address characteristics, skills, and abilities required to run a business (e.g. organizational abilities, bookkeeping, marketing products or services). 2. Business Profile: A description of the self-employment product or service to be marketed by the participant, the type of business, the geographic area to be served by the enterprise, licenses or permits, zoning considerations, etc. This is to include a summary of marketing strategy and the plan for developing a stable customer base, as well as an operations overview that itemizes the equipment, supplies, inventory, and other items needed during the first six months to start- up the venture along with their associated costs. The self-employment place of business shall also be identified. [NOTE: In order to operate a viable self- employment enterprise there must be a stable, permanent place of business. This may be the participant’s home or another location; in any event, the location must be stable and not subject to change during the first 12 months of operation.] As part of the marketing strategy this section should include a Market analysis (i.e., identification of participant’s target market, projected changes to the market, competitors and their strengths and weaknesses, etc.) and a marketing plan (i.e., promotional strategies, pricing methods, advertising, public relations, description of how the proposed products or services are different from any competitors, etc). 3. Financial Profile: A financial management plan of the projected monthly income and expenses for the first 12 months, including start-up and subsequent operating costs, break-even analysis, cash flow analysis, income statement, and balance sheet. This section should also include as attachments: a current credit report; listing of collateral the participant intends to use in securing capital for the self-employment venture; copies of appropriate insurance, licenses, permits needed for the business; copies of the participant's Federal Income Tax filings for the previous two years; and a completed personal financial statement showing assets, liabilities, and monthly expenses. 4. Summary Statement: An overview of the first year projections related to hours to be worked, projected earnings, length of period required to run independently and show an income that meets their monthly financial needs. This should also include an outline of \"critical issues\", such as unexpected repair of equipment, which are potential barriers to success, and a plan of action designed to overcome these issues. 5. Attachments: any supporting documents including an attachment that describes the list of items requested to be paid for by bureau and their cost and items and resources that the participant will contribute to the plan if this information is not already included within the plan. 241 10 B. When a Business Plan is not needed: All self-employment ventures require the development of a business plan prior to approval of bureau support for the business/self-employment except when: 1. The self-employment venture is a low-cost, home-based plan where the participant is not expecting to be self-sufficient through the self-employment venture alone (Tier 1). In these cases, the individual would need to complete a business proposal 2. The rehabilitation services needed by the individual are not associated with starting or maintaining a business 3. The participant returns to or continues in their own business that has a history of being successful; in these instances, the participant must provide copies of income tax returns or other financial documents, which indicate the existence of a viable business. C. Special Considerations in IPE Development for self-employment plans: Once self-employment is agreed to by the VR counselor and participant and the necessary approvals are obtained, an IPE is developed which incorporates self-employment as a part of the vocational goal and includes the following elements as part of the plan: 1. A clear statement defining the nature and extent of bureau’s support and participation (time lines, dollar amounts, specific goods and/or services to be provided, etc.); 2. A clear statement of the role and responsibilities of the participant, including a statement that the participant agrees to report all income in accordance with State and Federal requirements; 3. A clear statement of the participant contribution of other resources to assist in establishing and maintaining the business; 4. Clear criteria for measuring progress and a plan to monitor and evaluate the success of the self-employment objective through periodic reviews or activities and financial reports. Essential issues for review during the first three to six months include marketing/outreach activities and cash flow. Continued VR support to the business venture should be contingent upon the periodic review and submission of financial reports, as scheduled; 5. The agreed upon point when the business is considered stable and clear criteria for determining when the business will be considered to have a successful employment outcome, such as when the business has passed the break-even point and is producing an acceptable income to the participant. The break-even point is defined as the point at which business income equals expenses; 6. Identification of any training services, e.g., Training in how to start a business, Bookkeeping, Tax prep and reporting, etc. Participation in training in operating a small business is highly recommended, if the participant has no previous training or experience. Optional classes, memberships, meetings, mentoring relationships that the individual will be involved in to increase their opportunities for success shall also be listed; and 7. A listing of comparable services and benefits that will contribute to support of the self- employment enterprise. The participant will be expected to pursue comparable benefits and other resources to support business development as a part of the IPE. D.

I. Introduction Entrepreneurship may provide an opportunity to create jobs in New Hampshire in which there are few, if any, other sources of gainful employment. It may also allow for more flexibility and control over the terms and conditions of work for the customer. The bureau has a responsibility to balance the wise management of public funds with the appropriate provision of services to as many eligible customers as possible. To promote an efficient and viable small business, the bureau and its participants need to develop strong relationships with business, financial, educational, and community resources that focus on assisting aspiring entrepreneurs. The bureau recognizes that participants who make a personal commitment to such a goal have a greater opportunity for success. II. Procedure I. The following is the step-by-step process necessary for supporting the establishment of a small business as a goal for bureau participants. The tentative goal of small business ownership is identified by the participant 1. Potential entrepreneurs should be identified as early as possible in the vocational rehabilitation process. The VRC and participant must review the advantages and disadvantages of operating as a self- employment venture. They must also discuss the rationale for the participant operating his or her small business as opposed to working as an employee in an established business. 2. VRC provides ongoing counseling and guidance throughout the process of the small business development. 3. The VRC reviews the potential implications of operating a small business with the participant. 4. If the participant is still comfortable with the tentative goal of operating a small business after reviewing the potential implications, then the VRC must use data from their comprehensive assessment to determine if this would be an appropriate vocational goal for the customer. 5. The participant should attend any additional assessments, consultations or trainings with resources in the community as part of the comprehensive assessment process if deemed necessary by the VRC. 245 10 6. If the data from the comprehensive assessment supports the customer’s vocational goal of small business ownership, then the VRC and participant must draft an IPE or IPE amendment with a tentative vocational goal to include self-employment development objectives. The IPE with the tentative vocational goal must include criteria for developing and presenting a viable and practical business plan or proposal. a. At this time the plan type would be competitive integrated employment, the plan type would not include checking the self-employment box until the self-employment goal was approved. 7. The participant, with VRC or other assistance as needed, develops a business plan or proposal. They should utilize resources in the community to assist with the development of a business plan, especially if they have no prior experience with writing a business plan. 8. The participant presents the finalized business plan to the VRC. The participant must demonstrate that they are fully knowledgeable of the contents of the business plan and how the plan will be executed. The bureau may utilize third party expertise from resources in the community as part of the evaluation process if deemed necessary. 9. If the business plan or proposal is approved by the __director or designee________________, then the VRC and participant will amend the IPE to finalize the vocational goal and include any necessary services to assist with the small business startup. The IPE amendment must also include criteria for periodically reviewing the self-employment venture’s progress, criteria for determining the success of the small business and criteria for closing the participant’s case. 10. The self-employment is monitored for a minimum of 180 days by the VRC. 11. Once the criteria for closure and success have been met, and the participant is no longer in need of services, the VRC will close the participant’s case as successfully rehabilitated.

I. Introduction The bureau provides time-limited ongoing support services for persons with the most significant disabilities who require job site training and a variety of ongoing support services to achieve a supported employment outcome in a competitive integrated setting. II. Procedure A. VRC assures that participant meets criteria for receipt of supported employment services (MSD; requires long term support)) B. VRC provides for necessary assessment to determine employment goal and nature and scope of services 1. Due to severity of disability VRC should include participants circle of supports in assessment and planning 2. Discovery, person-centered planning, and community-based assessments should be considered C. VRC should explore benefit analysis and benefit counseling with the participant D. VRC develops IPE in accordance with policy: 404 Comprehensive assessment and 411 Individualized Plan for Employment. E. Considerations in IPE planning and development 1. In development of the IPE the VRC must identify that extended supports must be reasonably expected to become available 2. If an extended support resource cannot be identified a. Inform the individual that supported employment services under an IPE cannot be initiated until an extended support resource is identified or there is a reasonable expectation a resource will become available; and b. Seek out the needed extended support services including natural supports. If extended services cannot be identified within 90 days, case closure with the reason of “extended services not available” may be necessary. An extension (Eligible-E) may be used if there is an identified potential extended services resource that has not yet been investigated or from whom there has not been a final response. 3. Hourly work goal should also be considered when developing the IPE and in placement. This goal is very individualized and is determined by the work tolerance of the individual as well as the job itself. The hourly work goal should be discussed and set in collaboration with the participant. Benefits counseling should be offered to assist with understanding and planning of work incentives, reporting and impact on wages and benefits. 4. If the original IPE did not identify supported employment as the plan type or as a planned service, the IPE must be amended to include supported employment. 254 10 F. Considerations in service provision: services are provided in accordance with bureau policies including: 414 Service Statuses and Section 500 Services 1. VRC monitors participant’s progress to assure they are attaining skills needed to perform job and to assess when they meet job stability 2. VRC maintains contact with long-term support provider to coordinate transfer to extended supports occurs at agreed upon time frame, or criteria G. Transfer to Extended Services (Long-term supports) 1. In collaboration with long-term support provider, RC transfers services to extended, follow along services. Best practice is to schedule a team meeting to discuss transfer to long term support 2. In case of youth with disability where bureau is providing extended services a. Employment data page indicate bureau providing long-term support (Employed-X Status) b. Develop a monitoring plan H. Closure: The VRC closes the case in accordance with policy: 416 Program Exit 1. Considerations in closure of supported employment case a. Successful – VRC may close case 90 days after transition to long-term support services after verification that the participant has maintained job stability for 90 cumulative calendar days, required documentation has been obtained and a closure meeting has been completed to discuss the closure with the participant. b. Unsuccessful closure (1) Supported employment cases are closed unsuccessful when the individual has received 24 months of training or job placement services under an IPE and: (a) Is not earning the minimum wage or is working in a non-integrated setting. The employment status at closure for these individuals is “extended employment”. (Do not confuse extended employment with extended services; extended employment is used only at closure to describe an employment status.) ; or (b) Extended services are not available. This type of closure should only be used when due diligence has been followed to prior to initiating the IPE and subsequent work to secure long term support services. 255 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 520 Revision # Original Implementation Date 4/1/2021 Page # 1 of 5 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: Supportive Services I.

DESCRIPTION: Policy in this section defines bureau participation in assistance with transportation in relation to the provision of rehabilitation services II. DEFINITIONS: Basic vehicle: A motorized conveyance which is to be used on a public highway; the term does not include adaptations necessitated by the disability. Transportation Services: Travel and related expenses that are necessary to enable an applicant or eligible individual to participate in a vocational rehabilitation service. Transportation services may include, but are not limited to, public transportation costs, travel reimbursement, vehicle repair, and relocation. Note: Bureau funds may not be used to pay fines imposed on a participant by the legal system, nor can bureau funds be used to pay for other legally imposed sanctions or requirements. Driver Rehabilitation Services: include driver education, driver’s training and extended driver evaluation, used to teach an individual with a disability how to drive with or without vehicle modifications. Driver Education. Classroom instruction in preparation for an operator’s license. Driver Training. Driver’s training consists of behind-the-wheel instruction required to teach an individual with a disability to drive with or without vehicle modifications. III. POLICY: A. Transportation, including adequate training in the use of public transportation vehicles and systems means travel and related expenses that are necessary to enable an applicant or eligible individual to participate in a vocational rehabilitation service. 1. Transportation may be provided only in connection with the provision of another VR service, when needed by the individual to achieve an employment outcome; or to enable the customer to participate in the informal review or administrative hearing procedures. Transportation services may include, but are not limited to, 263 public transportation costs, travel reimbursement, vehicle repair, relocation, and other costs such as expenses for training in the use of public transportation vehicles and systems. 2. Participants are expected to provide their own transportation. The bureau will only participate in transportation costs when comparable services, benefits, and customer resources are not available. The least expensive method will always be chosen unless contraindicated by the disability. a. Public Transportation: Only customary fares shall be paid b. Travel reimbursement: Reimbursement for transportation in a privately owned vehicle shall be determined by the following formula, taking into account the individual’s unique circumstance and any available comparable services and benefits. To compute the amount paid for mileage, multiply the mileage for one trip by the number of trips; divide that by average gas mileage of the vehicle. Then multiply that number by the average cost of gas per gallon. The customer is responsible for the cost of regular maintenance to the vehicle. i. ii. If the individual is not a driver, the individual must provide a plan to the counselor that describes how they will utilize family members, personal care attendants or others as drivers in support of the rehabilitation plan; the counselor will document this in the case record. B. Vehicle Repair - Vehicle repair – Maintaining and repairing a private vehicle is primarily the responsibility of the owner. The bureau does not routinely pay for vehicle registration, license plates, insurance, inspection, depreciation and/or routine maintenance for vehicles because these are part of the typical costs of maintaining a vehicle. Repair can be used to assist customers in travel when this would be the least expensive method of providing necessary travel for rehabilitation services to be provided. 1. The Bureau will not pay for routine maintenance. Routine maintenance includes tune- ups, oil changes, tire rotation, tire replacements, fluids, filters, spark plugs, light bulbs, and wipers. 2. Assistance with vehicle repair is intended for emergency situations where services have been initiated under the IPE and participation in the IPE cannot continue without the repair. Generally, this will mean that the vehicle cannot be driven without the repair. If the vehicle needs emergency repair, the cost of that repair shall not exceed the blue book value of the car. a. Prior to agreeing to pay fora car repair, the VR counselor must determine that the vehicle can legally be driven and that the driver can legally drive. b. Automobile repairs will not be supported until after an IPE has been developed and approved. d. Prior to IPE implementation counselors and customers will find other means to 264 meet the customer’s transportation need. e. VR support for car repair is limited to $2000 for the lifetime of the case and if less, no more than the total blue book value of the car per participant during the life of the case. i.)Any exception to the car repair limit must be reviewed by a supervisor and approved by the Director, exceptions must be based on unique disability related needs of an individual f. Towing costs and diagnostic testing related to the specific vehicle repair can be paid for by the bureau. These costs are separate and should not be factored into the overall blue book value car repair limit. g. Vehicle repairs will be provided only by qualified dealers or repair shops that can provide a warranty/guarantee for their services. h. Prior to repair, three quotes must be obtained. The three quotes must contain the same repair information; the bureau will choose the lowest quote unless justification is provided. C. Vehicle Purchasing – The bureau will not provide financial assistance in the purchase or lease of a vehicle. D. Other Related Expenses – Other transportation related expenses can be paid for by the bureau if they are required to assist the customer in achieving their employment goal. Examples include bicycles, parking permits. 1. The bureau will not pay for parking/traffic fines. 2. The bureau will not pay for driver’s license renewal. E. Driver evaluation or driver training will be provided when in support of the objectives in the IPE or the employment goal. 1. Driver instructors or evaluators must be Certified, either a. a Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist by ADED Association of Driver Educators for Disabled) or b. When the lack of a driver’s license appears to be non-disability related, VRC may opt to authorize training directly from a Certified Driver Education Instructor, training program. If after completing that training, the participant has not obtained their license, whether having failed the test or not developing skills required to take the test, it is best practice to refer for a driver evaluation with a CDRS. (i) Driver Evaluation and Training is a means by which the bureau can work with an individual with a disability and their family to determine if the individual can drive a vehicle, or, if not, what the needs are to be a passenger; and what type of vehicle will me et their needs. (ii) Driver evaluation and training services may be provided to eligible individuals with a transportation barrier to achieving their employment outcome. (iii) Driver Evaluation - This is an assessment of an individual's abilities and/or potential to become a safe, independent driver. The driver 265 evaluation will provide information on the person's current driving ability, and when applicable, recommend driver training needs, and equipment needs for the individual. 2. Driver evaluation is also used when the individual expresses an interest in purchasing a vehicle. A referral to the Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist is done requesting an evaluation of appropriate vehicle and factory equipment the individual needs to look for, when shopping fora vehicle. F. Driver Training - This training must assist the individual in restoring or developing \"behind the wheel\" competency in a variety of actual traffic situations to ready the individual for obtaining or retaining a driver's license. Prerequisites: The following must be met before starting driver training:  Driving must not be medically contra-indicated  The individual has a valid driver's license or eligible to apply fora driver’s license  The bureau has determined that the individual will have access to an appropriate vehicle for training and employment  Comparable benefits have been explored and the individual is not eligible for training services under other programs (e.g., Veterans Administration or High School driver training program) When applicable economic need is determined G. Public transportation or other means of transportation are either unavailable or unsuitable. Individuals with significant physical or cognitive limitations must obtain the driver evaluation from a Bureau approved Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist. 1. For other individuals the option of obtaining a driver evaluation from an approved Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) driving school is available. (Adaptive Driver Training - The training is provided on a vehicle with appropriate equipment matched to the driver's needs. The training must develop \"behind the wheel\" competency in a full range of roadway environments to ready the individual for obtaining or retaining a driver's license Only individuals requiring modifications, specialized training and/or adaptive equipment because of their disability should enroll in this training. The training should be based on the evaluation report of the Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist. H. Financial Need: Transportation services are subject to financial need requirements. I. Comparable benefits: Transportation services are subject to comparable service and benefit requirements. 266 517.A.3.P Transportation Procedure Revision date: See corresponding policy: Transportation Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for bureau staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group.

Bureau participation in costs provisions. In addition to requirements identified in B of this policy 1. VRNH is not a general source of financial support for post-secondary education. VRNH funding is intended to support services required to achieve an employment goal that meets the needs of the participant. If an individual or their family is just seeking financial support for a post-secondary degree, they should be advised to seek assistance from other sources of financial aid including Pell and institutional grants and scholarships. 2. The bureau may provide for cost of tuition, fees, room, board, books and educational supplies on an annual basis, an amount up to $10,000 after the application of financial participation requirements and comparable benefits. Distribution of the funding may not exceed $5,000 per academic term for college and university programs with multiple terms over the course of the year. For other training programs that do not operate on academic terms but require one upfront payment for the cost of the program, distribution of funds may also be used in entirety for the program. This $10,000 is identified as the ‘VR Post-secondary Ed Grant’ (PEG). a. This assistance applies to costs of in-state or out-of-state programs and institutions. b. VRNH will support the lowest cost option to meet participant’s IPE needs. Preference will be given to in-state public post-secondary institutions for both programs that offer financial aid and for those that do not. Consistent with 308 Fees and Expenditures policy, students who choose more costly programs are responsible for the additional costs of attendance. c. The bureau calculates need for the PEG based upon the institution’s rates for tuition, fees, room, board, and books minus any grants and scholarships including the Pell Grant and expected student and family contribution. d. The bureau’s contribution cannot replace the expected family contribution, as determined by the financial institution using the Student Aid Index in contribution to the individual’s cost of attendance at a post-secondary institution, except if the individual in need of service has been determined 272 eligible for Social Security benefits under titles II or XVI (SSI/SSDI) of the Social Security Act due to their disability or is receiving needs based public benefits, i.e., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), or Aid to Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD). Recipients of SSI/SSDI, TANF, SNAP and APTD are not subject to a financial means test. These participants are still required to apply for financial aid (grants and scholarships) as outlined in policy. e. The PEG does not include disability-related expenses necessary to access the training. These expenses may be provided in addition to any PEG assistance. f. DVR may not authorize a PEG that results in an over award of financial aid grants. The PEG may not replace or decrease any other grants. g. When VRNH funds are not needed by an educational institution due to subsequent replacement by college grants, need based scholarships or dropped classes, VRNH staff shall notify the institution that these funds are to be returned to VRNH and not to the individual or credited to a loan balance. If VRNH funds are reimbursed to the individual or credited to a loan balance, an equal amount will be counted against the student’s financial support from VRNH for the following semester. 3. If a participant does not pass a course(s) or withdraws following the designated drop period for the post-secondary institution, they are responsible to cover costs to repeat the course(s). 4. The cost of transportation necessary to access training may be provided as an additional service and is not included in the PEG assistance. 5. Work Study and Loans: Through the application for federal financial aid, students with demonstrated financial need may be offered the opportunity to work in exchange for money for college expenses. Likewise, students and their families may be offered low interest loans. While VRNH does not require that individuals take out loans or work in work-study programs, students may choose to use these as a means to defray educational costs. 6. Student Loan Default provisions: If a participant is in default of a student loan, financial aid including Pell will not be available to the individual. VRNH is prohibited from paying for any training or related services at a post-secondary program which is eligible for federal assistance such as Pell funds (including, but not limited to, colleges and business and trade schools) for an individual who owes a refund on a grant or is in default of a student loan, unless the individual makes maximum effort to resolve the default. Maximum effort means that the participant has worked out a satisfactory repayment plan with the lender or grantor and has reestablished eligibility for financial aid. 7. Tutoring a. The bureau will pay for tutoring only after the individual has exhausted no-cost tutoring services available from the post-secondary institution. Tutoring is typically provided when it is recommended by the course instructor and/or the individual is at risk of course failure. b. The bureau will not fund tutoring as a general academic support in order for an individual to maintain an average grade point average. The cost for the tutoring services must be reasonable and based upon the education level and expertise of the tutor. c. The bureau will not pay a family member for tutoring services. 273 8. Comprehensive Transition Programs (CTP) a. Participation in a Comprehensive Transition Program (CTP) may be an allowable VR service when determined to be reasonable, necessary, and a required service for the participant to achieve their employment goal. b. Individuals participating in the CTP are limited to no more than four semesters c. The participant must be attending or seeking to attend an approved CTP. This means that the college or university hosting the program has either: i. received approval from the Department of Education to offer financial aid to eligible students. A list of approved Comprehensive Transition Programs can be found at: https://studentaid.gov/understand- aid/eligibility/requirements/intellectual-disabilities; or ii. is operating a Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disability (TPSID) model demonstration project approved and currently being funded by the US Department of Education. A list of current TPSID grantees (2020 – 2025) can be found at: https://thinkcollege.net/projects/national-coordinating-center/what-is-a- tpsid d. The participant must be accepted and enroll in the CTP. e. Services must be provided directly by the CTP or Institution of Higher Education personnel f. Integrated community setting must be available for all services g. Participants must demonstrate satisfactory progress each semester for VRNH to continue to support their participant in the CTP. h. A written report of attendance, services provided, and satisfactory progress participant is making including outcomes achieved is required to be provided at least each semester. i. CTPs are required to have defined standards for evaluation of student progress. ii. The VRC will analyze the report(s) prior to authorizing the next semester based on demonstration of satisfactory progress. i. Financial support for a CTP is provided at the VRNH participation rate for costs as identified in B. and F. of this policy. j. CTP must include the auxiliary aids, services, and accommodations for the participant to participate in the program. k. The participant and their family must demonstrate financial need and comparable benefit search. 9. Graduate Study a. The bureau may participate in assisting with advance degree programs (including master’s and doctoral programs) when a masters or doctoral degree is necessary to pursue the specific employment outcome. b. Graduate study may be supported only when approved by the Director, or the Director’s designee. c. Approval for the anticipated degree level and employment goals that require training at that degree level are to be obtained prior to its addition to the IPE. 10. Training Outside of the United States: Training at an institution outside of the United States will not be funded unless it is part of an approved course of study for an in-state institution. If the home educational institution requires out-of-country instruction as part of the individual’s program, VRNH may support it at the same 274 rate as if the program were provided at the student’s home educational institution. 11. Financial need: Post-secondary training is subject to financial need requirements. 12. Comparable benefits: Post-secondary training is subject to comparable benefit requirements. I. Personal and vocational adjustment training requirements 1. Services provided under this section include job preparation and job search training, employment preparation assessment and training and work adjustment training, and any related books and training materials. 2. Provided by approved community rehabilitation providers and VRNH staff (e.g., VRC, Employment Specialists, and Student Transition Specialists) 3. Financial need: Personal and vocational adjustment training are exempt from financial need requirements. 4. Comparable Benefits: Personal and vocational adjustment training are exempt from comparable benefit requirements. J. On-the-Job Training (OJT) requirements (refer to 518.H OJT Policy) 275 518.P Training Procedure Revision date: 7/1/2023 See corresponding policy: Vocational and other training services. Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for bureau staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. I. PROCEDURE A. College 1. The VRC assists the individual in thoroughly exploring whether postsecondary education is required for the employment goal and, if so, determining the major that will be best to prepare the individual for employment. This exploration includes using labor market information to identify employment opportunities that exist in the local area. a. Enrolling in a post-secondary degree program is often a major time and financial commitment for the participant. As part of the guidance and counseling process, the VRC should engage the participant in informed decision making about a college program. Some considerations that might be part of this process include i. The acceptance, graduation, and placement rates of the program. ii. The financial commitment involved in competing the program and the potential student debt. iii. An understanding of the workload requirements. iv. Family obligations and other commitments. v. Supports and accommodations the student may need and the availability of and access to disability services. vi. Differences between High School Individual Education Plan (IEP) support and the supports a college is required to provide. vii. Expectations for engagement in the VR process regarding post-secondary training b. In some cases, participants might not be aware of non-college options to achieve highly marketable credentials. Options such as apprenticeships or short-term training programs leading to industry recognized credentials can be much less expensive options for participants to reach their employment goals. 2. The VRC assures that the IPE is written for the entire length of the agreed upon training at the college or university. The IPE includes: 1. The specific definition of satisfactory progress such as minimum grades and attendance. 2. Statements about requirement to apply for available financial aid to the cost of training before VR funds are authorized. 3. Statements about the responsibility of the participant to inform VRC of any changes that would impact employment plan, when experiencing problems with coursework, changes to coursework such as add/drop, incompletes. 3. Prior to the start of the training VR staff create an education goal for the training – anyone enrolled in training needs to have an education goal in the case management system. a. VR Staff to obtain proof of program enrollment. Documents can include acceptance letter, class schedule, invoice from college/university/training program. A detailed case note can be substituted if VR Staff are not successful in obtaining documentation after two well-documented attempts. 4. VRC discusses supports to address any disability issues to assist the individual in maintaining stability so that they have the best chance for academic success. This includes discussion of the role of the disability services office at the postsecondary institution. 276 5. Each semester VRC obtains grades and reviews progress toward the agreed upon degree or certificate and the next semester’s courses. 6. At end of semester or training program VRC records MSG or credential as applicable. 7. Every year that the participant attends a college or university setting they should be advised to complete the FAFSA in a timely manner. 8. Every year that the participant attends college or university comparable benefit, and financial need are assessed using the documentation provided by the student including their FAFSA Submission Summary, Financial Aid Award letter, and Tuition Bill. 9. VRC should apprise and encourage, as appropriate, the individual of Disability Services. B. Comprehensive Transition Programs – Additional requirements for CTP 1. Prior to writing a plan that includes CTP training the VRC identifies: a. The CTP is a necessary and required service for the participant to achieve their goal. b. As with any other case including post-secondary education, the VRC will work with the individual to determine a suitable employment outcome and necessary services to achieve their employment goal. c. VRCs routinely determine whether the qualifications of the employment outcome require post-secondary education. In considering this for individuals with intellectual disabilities the VRC should: i. evaluate with the individual, and other relevant team members, how inclusive higher education will support their attainment of the employment outcome; ii. determine whether the nature of the individual’s disability requires a level of training beyond that identified in minimal qualifications; and iii. maintain a perspective that honors the capability, potential growth, and informed choice of the individual. d. VRC completes the comprehensive assessment data page with rationale supporting how CTP will enhance the participant’s employment potential and assist in the achievement of their employment goal, e.g., specific skills, experiences, and training that is expected to be acquired during the CPT program and how it directly leads to the employment goal/job. 2. The VRC assures that the Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) is written for the entire length of the agreed upon training at the college or university. The IPE includes: a. The specific definition of satisfactory progress such as minimum grades and attendance. In programs where course auditing is used, identify the CTP’s defined standards for evaluation of student progress to use as criteria. b. Statements about requirement to apply for available financial aid to the cost of training before VR funds are authorized, as applicable (may not be available for programs in model demonstration projects). c. Statements about the responsibility of the participant to inform VRC of any changes that would impact the employment plan, when experiencing problems with coursework, changes to coursework such as add/drop, incompletes. 3.

Every year that the participant attends a college or university setting they should be advised to complete the FAFSA in a timely manner, as appropriate. 7. Every year that the participant attends college or university comparable benefit, and financial need are assessed using the documentation provided by the student including their FAFSA Submission Summary, Financial Aid Award letter, and Tuition Bill. In cases where the program is running under a current TPSID grant and not yet approved to offer financial aid, the Financial Needs Assessment (FNA) is used to calculate participant and family contribution. C. Pursuit of a higher degree: When researching support of a graduate degree: 277 1. Explore capacity of the individual and the employment potential with and without the degree. a. There should be consideration of other related vocational goals which do not require advanced training and b. A determination of the necessary level of training for the vocational goal. 2. Graduate training may be considered, if the participant has not been able to locate suitable entry-level employment in the field of choice with an undergraduate degree and graduate work will significantly enhance the opportunities in the field of choice. 3. Participants must demonstrate the academic ability to complete graduate level coursework. The VRC can request the participant provide information regarding most recent college transcripts and acceptance from graduate university program. When documentation is not recent or provide sufficient information about the person’s ability, the VRC could consider additional assessments such as work/training experience or assessment. 4. Complete waiver request with relevant support for the advanced degree. 5. Follow college, university requirements for Ed goal, measurable skills gains, grade reporting. D. Personal and vocational adjustment training (including disability-related training and other Community Rehabilitation Program (CRP) services) 1. VRC works with the participant to choose a vendor 2. VRC facilitates referral to vendor 3. VRC reviews vendor reports and determines next steps, I.e., continued vendor services, or alternative action 4. VRC maintains contact with participant to assure working relationship with vendor is maintained, there are not issues that need additional action, and that progress is being made. E. On the Job Training (refer to OJT policy and procedure) 278 27 Policy Type Service Policy Number 518.H Revision # Original Implementation Date 9/1/2022 Page # 1 1 of 3 Last Reviewed/Update Date None Policy Title: On-the Job Training I. DESCRIPTION: OJT is a type of training that is provided by an employer to a participant (job seeker). During the training, the participant is engaged in productive work in a job for which the participant is paid, and the training provides the knowledge or skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the job. OJT may be provided by an employer in the public, private non-profit or private sectors. II. DEFINITIONS: On-the-job training: A structured process conducted at the workplace to provide the employee with the knowledge and skills to perform job tasks a means of providing short-term training for a particular job in an actual work setting. III. POLICY: On-the-job training (OJT) offers the opportunity for individuals to learn a job directly at the job site, with the business owner or an assigned co-worker providing training specific to that position. A. On-The-Job Training is a means of providing short-term training for a particular job in an actual work setting. 1. An employer teaches a participant the specific skills they need to perform the job. 2. The participant is given an opportunity to demonstrate employment potential and to achieve job competency for placement upon successful completion of the training. 3. The expected outcome is employment with that employer or with another employer in the same or related field. B. On-The-Job training requires a written agreement among the participant, the counselor, and the employer. The agreement must state the hourly wage, responsibility for Workers' Compensation coverage, and any other conditions of employment. C. When a participant is receiving On-The-Job Training, the conditions of training and wage payment must comply with State and Federal wage and hour laws. 279 27 D. VR Staff and VR CRPs shall consider the appropriateness of OJT for job-ready individuals who need additional training and work experience to gain hard skills in a job setting that may lead to higher wage employment. E. OJT may be offered in lieu of formal training in an employment area where formal training is limited or does not exist, or in lieu of formal training fora participant who may learn better on the actual job site rather than learning in a classroom setting and then transferring that knowledge to a workplace. F. When considering OJT, the training needs of the individual shall exceed the training provided by the employer when hiring individuals without disabilities for the same or substantially equivalent work. G. OJT shall be provided in accordance with the following provisions. 1. An agreement will be established between the employer/trainer, the trainee/participant, and the rehabilitation counselor. 2. The agreement will include the specific job title for which training is to be provided, the objectives of the training, the length of time training is to be provided, evaluation procedures, financial arrangements, and any other pertinent information. 3. An OJT agreement must be limited to the period of time required for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the agreement, consideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's IPE. 4. The employer/trainer will agree to pay the trainee (participant) at least the minimum wage as established by federal law and provide all appropriate benefits under state and federal laws pertaining to Workers’ Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, and Social Security. 5. An On-the-Job Training Agreement (OJT) will be completed and signed by the employer/trainer, the trainee/participant, and the counselor with a copy to the employer/trainer, trainee, and case record. 6. Agency financial participation for OJT will be determined based on the hourly wage of the person or people designated to provide one -on-one training to the new employee (or an= agreed-upon training wage based on up-to-date labor market information). 280 28 H. Reporting requirements – As specified on the Agreements, monthly reporting of progress is required I. Staff may provide consultation to the employer in order to accommodate the participant’s disability-related needs, and/or provide limited job coaching to the participant on relevant soft skills. J. Financial Need: On-the-Job Training services are not subject to financial need requirements. K. Comparable benefits: On-the-Job Training services are not subject to comparable service and benefit requirements. 281 28 518.H.P On-the-Job Training Procedure See corresponding policy: OJT Note: Vocational Rehabilitation procedures provide internal guidance for VRNH staff only and create no procedural or substantive rights for any individual or group. II. Procedure As part of employer outreach and development A. Once an employer has expressed interest in hiring and providing OJT to individuals, VR Staff will determine if the employer’s information is currently in the case management system. This can also be done in the process of negotiating the plan. 1. If the employer is an active vendor in the vendor module of the case management system, the VRC shall discuss the possibility of OJT utilizing the “OJT info letter” to guide the discussion. 2. If the employer is not an Employer of record in the case management system, VR Staff shall discuss the possibility of OJT utilizing the “OJT Info letter” to guide the discussion and discuss needed information to enter the employer into the case management system B. If a CRP has introduced the employer to the OJT opportunity, the VRC assures that the employment opportunity meets OJT provisions and that the employer is knowledgeable about the process and requirements of providing an OJT to the participant. C. An “On-the-Job Training (OJT) Negotiated Agreement” is to be developed for each individual hired by the Employer 1. Prior to developing a negotiated agreement and adding OJT services to an individual’s “Individualized Plan for Employment” (IPE), VR Staff shall ensure that the criteria below are met. a. The “OJT Info letter” has been reviewed with the Employer and/or, if applicable, the Employer Designee. b. A copy of the position description from the Employer and/or, if applicable, the Employer Designee, has been obtained and scanned into the case management system. c. The Employer and/or, if applicable, the Employer Designee, has signed 282 28 negotiated OJT agreement” prior to each individual being hired. d. The VRC completes the negotiated agreement with the employer, or designee including all the items listed below. (1) The trainee (i.e. employee) name and the position to which they are being hired. (2) OJT Employer or Employer Designee name (i.e., whoever will be providing the training), the name of their contact person and their email.

(5) Skills to be learned during OJT. i. VR Staff shall work with the Employer and/or, if applicable, the Employer Designee, to determine specific hard skills to be learned, the trainee’s skills gap in these areas, the timeframe for learning each skill, and how the learning of each skill will be measured. ii. At a minimum, the listed skills shall be the same skills required to be learned by employees without disabilities who will be performing the same or substantially equivalent work. (6) Required signatures (including dates) as listed below: i. the OJT Employer and if applicable, the Employer Designee; ii. the trainee; and iii. the appropriate VR Staff e. If the OJT is not currently on the IPE, the plan is amended to include the OJT service (1) The OJT agreement shall not be implemented until all required signatures (and dates) are obtained on the agreement and the IPE. (2) The OJT agreement is written with the understanding that after the training portion of the agreement is completed the trainee (participant) will be hired unless they were unable to achieve the training objectives in the OJT agreement. (3) VR Staff may authorize on-the-job support services (i.e., barrier intervention for coaching, retention, supported employment) in conjunction with OJT only if it is necessary for the individual to access the training. To avoid duplication of services, on-the-job support services shall not be authorized to provide the hard skills training the individual is receiving, from the employer, as outlined in the OJT Plan. D. Once agreement is signed, VRC adds Ed Goal of On-the-Job Training to the case record As monthly completed satisfactory report – note skills progression in measurable skill gain. 283 28 E.

POLICY: The bureau provides Transition Services to students and youth with disabilities as they transition from school to post-secondary activities and employment. The goal is to provide students and youth with disabilities with a smooth transition that incorporates a team approach, and individualized activities and services that are necessary and reasonable to help prepare for, obtain, and maintain employment. Towards this end the Agency partners with members of the school, including IEP and 504 teams; family, and other adult service agencies to ensure that transition- aged youth with disabilities have the supports needed to successfully transition from high school to adulthood, independence, and employment. A. Provision of Services Overview: Transition services are targeted to assist the transition of students and youth with disabilities from school to post-secondary life, through the provision of VR Transition Services. The bureau strives to service students with disabilities in transition in a manner that will impact the broadest segment of students possible through the provision of transition services which include pre-employment transition services (Policy 520 Pre-Employment Transition Services). 1. VR Counselor assists students and youth with disabilities to make informed choices in the development and pursuit of career interests with post-secondary education, vocational training, job search, job placement, job retention, job follow-up and job follow along services, including, but not limited to: 289 28 a) internships, on-the-job training, special programs available in the state to train youth to work with a specific employer, and apprenticeships. b) coordination with the American job centers in the state (NHWorks centers) c) supported employment or customized employment options, including the availability of extended services (Policy 516 Supported Employment) d) community colleges and universities that have disability supports. e) coordination with other agencies to provide wrap-around services for youth, e.g., developmental disabilities agency, the mental health agency, centers for independent living in the state, etc. f) benefits counseling g) peer mentoring opportunities or youth leadership initiatives 2. Transition from school to work requires a variety of supports and collaborative efforts among education and workforce programs. No one institution or organization can provide the full range of services that may be required to serve youth with disabilities. However, collaboration and coordinated efforts among education and workforce programs, including vocational rehabilitation, is essential in assisting students with disabilities to make the transition from school to employment. 3. The bureau maintains a formal Secondary Transition Intra-Agency Agreement between the New Hampshire Education Department, Bureau of Special Education Support (NHSES) and New Hampshire Education Department, Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation (VRNH) to assist with collaboration and partnering as well as to provide some framework for the working relationships between NHSES and local VRNH offices and with local education agencies (LEAs). 4. LEAs are responsible for providing and paying for any transition service that is considered special education or related services necessary for ensuring a free appropriate public education (FAPE), as required under IDEA. Nothing under this policy shall be construed as reducing a LEA’s obligation to provide transition services under IDEA. 5. Transition services are not separate from Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services; they are part of a continuum of VR services designed to assist eligible students and youth with disabilities achieve a successful vocational outcome. B. Role of the Bureau in Transition Services: The primary role is to provide career guidance and counseling, career assessments, and rehabilitation services related to career-connected activities to students and youth with disabilities. 1. Bureau supervisors and counselors shall collaborate with appropriate school personnel, family members, and students in support of preparation for post-secondary services and employment. School officials continue to be responsible for providing a free and appropriate public education. 2. As an active participant in the transition planning process, the VR counselor will: a) Inform students, parents and school staff about vocational rehabilitation policy and procedures as they relate to transition planning and rehabilitation services and outcomes; b) Work with the school district to appropriately identify students who may benefit from VR services; c) Counsel transitioning students and their parents about vocational and career planning and employment outcomes related to the individualized education program (IEP) by reviewing existing school records related to student; 290 29 d) Advise students, parents and school staff during the transition planning and service delivery process regarding current labor market information; community resources, including community-based services, the need for involvement by other state agencies, adult service programs, and independent living centers; e) Contribute to the transition planning by communicating with school-based staff so that students, parents, and school district staff can avail themselves of the VR counselors' expertise which may include attending IEP meetings, when invited ; f) Provide transition services, including pre-employment transition services, if they are beyond the scope of special education and within the scope of VR Services; and g) Provide employment related services. C. Outreach Responsibilities: The bureau will initiate outreach to students and youth with disabilities to identify those who are in need of transition services including: 1. Inform applicants and eligible students with disabilities who are making the transition from programs under the responsibility of an educational agency to programs under the responsibility of VR, through appropriate modes of communication, about the availability of and opportunities to exercise informed choice; including the availability of support services for individuals with cognitive or other disabilities who require assistance in exercising informed choice throughout the VR process; 2. Promote outreach to and identification of students with disabilities who are in need of transition services as early as possible during the transition planning process. Outreach to these students will include, at a minimum, a description of the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program, eligibility requirement, application procedures, and scope of services that may be provided to eligible individuals. Outreach activities can include the use of brochures, social media, attendance at back-to-school nights, transition events, etc. 3.

Financial responsibilities: All bureau financial policies and procedures apply to students with disabilities. (Policy 502 Participant Participation in the Costs of Vocational Rehabilitation 291 29 Services) E. Sub-minimum wage regarding students and youth with disabilities: The bureau does not hold specific policies relative to payment of subminimum wage provisions as the State of New Hampshire statute prohibits sub-minimum wage payment to individuals with disabilities, except in cases where students are working for practical experience, or they are working for family members. Related Statute: In New Hampshire NH-RSA Section 279:21 outlines Minimum Rate standards. Section 279:22 specifically states that except as provided in RSA 279:22-aa and RSA 279:26-a, no person shall employ any individual with a disability as an employee at an hourly rate lower than that set forth in RSA 279:21. 279:2-2aa High School and Post-Secondary Students; Workers with Disabilities. – I. Upon application by a participating employer or proper school authority, the labor commissioner may establish a sub-minimum wage rate, or no rate, for high school or post-secondary students working for practical experience, if circumstances warrant. Guidelines shall be established by the labor commissioner to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists between participating parties for such work in respect to existing labor laws. No such student shall be allowed to replace an existing worker or a laid-off worker. II. Upon application by a proper post-secondary organization or rehabilitation facility as defined by and in a manner established by the labor commissioner, the commissioner may establish a practical experience/training program at a sub-minimum wage rate or no wage rate for individuals with disabilities. If such program is established, the commissioner shall establish guidelines to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists between the parties for work performed through the program that is consistent with state and federal law. No such individual with disabilities, while in the program, shall be allowed to replace an existing worker or a laid-off worker. 279:26-a Application to Parents, Spouses, Etc. – The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to a child employed by his parents, grandparents, or person or persons in place of his parents or grandparents, employing his own child, grandchild, or a child in his custody, who furnishes full maintenance to such child. Nor shall the provisions apply to a spouse working for the other spouse on a volunteer basis when the spouse who works does not expect or claim any pay for the work, other than the support derived from the other spouse’s profits in the business. 292 29 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 520 Revision # 1 Implementation Date 9/1/2022 Page # 1 of 8 Last Reviewed/ Update 1/3/2024 PRE-EMPLOYMENT TRANSITION SERVICES I. DESCRIPTION and PURPOSE: The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), emphasizes services to students with disabilities. Vocational Rehabilitation agencies are required to set aside at least 15 percent of their federal funds for the provision of Pre- Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) for students with disabilities. It also expands the population of students with disabilities who may receive vocational rehabilitation services to include students who are potentially eligible. In New Hampshire, pre-employment transition services are available to students with disabilities up to their 22nd birthday. This age range is in accordance with the New Hampshire Department of Education state age range for the provision of transition services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The intent of pre-employment transition services is to: • improve the transition of students with disabilities from school to post-secondary education or to an employment outcome; • increase opportunities for students with disabilities to practice and improve workplace readiness skills, through work-based learning experiences in competitive, integrated work settings. and • increase opportunities for students with disabilities to explore post-secondary training options, leading to more industry recognized credentials, and meaningful post-secondary employment.

III. POLICY: The bureau provides pre-employment transition services (Pre-ETS) in collaboration with the local educational agencies to students with disabilities in need of these services who are eligible or potentially eligible for vocational rehabilitation services. A. Purpose: The primary purpose of Pre-ETS provided, or coordinated by the bureau, is to help students with disabilities begin to identify career interests and to learn skills in preparation for transition to employment and/or post-secondary education. Pre-ETS may begin once a student requests or is recommended for one or more pre-employment transition services; and must be provided or arranged in collaboration with local educational agencies (LEAs). B. Statewide Availability: VRNH makes required services available statewide to eligible and potentially eligible students with disabilities. Each local regional office is responsible for providing coordination activities to assist in the coordination and delivery of required Services and authorized services. C. Target population: 1. Pre-employment transition services are provided to those individuals who meet the definition of a Student with a Disability who are in a secondary, post-secondary, or other recognized education program who fall within the requirements for minimum and maximum age, and are either: a. Eligible for VR services; or b. Potentially eligible for VR services. 2. If the student with a disability is transitioning to post-secondary education and has a typical summer break prior to enrollment, the student with a disability may continue to receive Pre- ETS as long as VR has obtained the following documentation: a. Documentation that the individual with a disability graduated from secondary education; b. Documentation that the individual with a disability has been accepted into a post- secondary education institution/program; and 296 29 c. Documentation of the individual with a disability intention or confirmation that they have accepted the invitation to enter the post-secondary program. 3. If the student with a disability is transitioning to post-secondary education and plans to take a break or gap year prior to enrollment, the student with a disability may continue to receive Pre-ETS, as long as VRNH has obtained the following documentation: a. Documentation that the individual with a disability graduated from secondary education; b. Documentation that the individual with a disability has been accepted into a post- secondary education institution/program; c. Documentation of the individual with a disability’s intention or confirmation that they have accepted the invitation to enter the post-secondary program; and d. Documentation that the individual with a disability has been informed by the institution that their seat or spot is being held for them. D. Services Provided 1. The bureau will reserve at least 15 percent of the Federal allotment received to provide and arrange for, in coordination with local educational agencies, the provision of pre- employment transition services to students with disabilities. 2. Reserved funds may only be used for the provision of the following pre-employment services and activities: a. Required Pre-Employment Transition Services, b. Pre-Employment Transition Coordination, c. Auxiliary aids and services necessary for a student to participate in pre-employment transition services Authorized Services, and d. Authorized Services the bureau determines that there are funds available after the provision of required services. 3. In providing pre-employment services to eligible students with disabilities VRCs and STSs should identify if additional VR services are necessary for the student to receive and participate in pre-employment transition services. Any such services a. should be included in the student’s IPE. b. are not allocated to the reserve funding. 4. Pre-Employment Transition Services Fiscal Forecasting is completed annually by VRNH staff to determine whether reserve funds remain after the provision of re3quired and coordination activities to all students with disabilities in the state who need them. E. Provision of Auxiliary Aids and Service 1. No qualified student with a disability is denied pre-employment transition services on the basis of their disability. 2. If any student with a sensory or communicative impairment requires an auxiliary aid or service to access or participate in any of the required pre-employment transition services, the bureau can pay for those costs with Pre-ETS funds if no other public entity is required to provide such aids or services. 3. Pre-Employment Transition Services funds may not be used to purchase or modify a student’s personal equipment or devices. Personally prescribed devices and services do not 297 29 meet the definition of auxiliary aids and services and may not be charged to the pre- employment transition services reserve; however, they could be provided to eligible students with disabilities in accordance with an individualized plan for employment (IPE) using non reserved funds. 4. Auxiliary aids and services for Pre-Employment Transition Services do not include: • Personal devices (e.g., computers, laptops, tablets) • Prescribed devices (e.g., eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs) • Readers for personal use or study • Home or vehicle modifications • Attendant care or other services 5. Reasonable accommodation through auxiliary aids and services shall be provided in accordance with the bureau’s policies and procedures except the bureau does not need to conduct a search for comparable services and benefits for potentially eligible students with disabilities when providing auxiliary aids and services for participation in pre-ETS if these services are not otherwise available through the collaboration with schools as identified in the Secondary Transition Intra-Agency Agreement. F. Referrals for pre-employment transition services: In addition to the bureau’s referral for VR services policy (Policy 401 – Referral), a student may be referred for pre-employment transition services as potentially eligible. 1. A referral or request for Pre-Employment Transition Services may be submitted by school personnel, family members, post-secondary education programs, stakeholders, or other interested persons. 2. Once a Student Registration form is completed, the Student Transition Specialist will contact the legal guardian, parent, and/or student to discuss student services needs and provide information about the availability of pre-employment services and vocational rehabilitation services. 3. VR staff shall encourage interested students and parents/guardians if applicable to complete an application for VRNH to facilitate a smooth transition into vocational rehabilitation services. 4. Potentially eligible students with disabilities are not required to apply for or be determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation services before receiving pre-employment transition services. 5. Students who have provided adequate documentation of their disability and enrollment in a recognized education program shall not have their participation in pre-employment transition services delayed by the process of applying for vocational rehabilitation services. 6. Students who do not apply for vocational rehabilitation services may continue to receive pre-employment transition services as long as they continue to satisfy the definition of a student with a disability. 7. Students who apply for vocational rehabilitation services and are determined ineligible, cease to be considered potentially eligible and are therefore not able to continue to receive Pre-Employment Transition Services. Pre-Employment Transition Services should cease as soon as the ineligibility determination is made. 298 29 G. Outreach and Coordination: As with other transition services, pre-employment transition services will be provided in collaboration with local educational agencies (LEA). • LEAs are responsible for providing and paying for any transition service that is considered special education or related services necessary for ensuring a free appropriate public education (FAPE), as required under the IDEA. • VRNH’s Pre-employment transition services provided may not duplicate services that are already provided by local education agencies through the IDEA. • Decisions as to who will be responsible for providing services that are both special education services and vocational rehabilitation services are made as part of a collaborative process and is further defined in the Secondary Transition Intra-Agency Agreement between New Hampshire Education Department, Bureau of Special Education Support (NHSES) and New Hampshire Education Department, Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation (VRNH). • Nothing under this policy shall be construed as reducing a LEA’s obligation to provide under IDEA. 1. Bureau supervisors, student transition specialist, counselors, and business service representatives will develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with state and local secondary education staff (including alternative school programs), post-secondary education staff, state operated programs, and workforce development partners (i.e., American Job Centers, WIOA youth, etc.) to coordinate Pre-ETS. 2.

VR Central Office staff will work with the Office of Business Management (OBM) on a quarterly basis to calculate the value of the recorded staff time and transfer that portion of salary and benefits to be allocated toward the reserve. a. Actual Service data for VR Staff members (excluding STS) is gathered for the specific quarter and totals are generated for each staff member. b. Data from the time tracking spreadsheet for STS Counselors is gathered for the specific quarter in a master spreadsheet and totals are generated for each staff member. c. The Office of Business Management uses this information and payroll reports to allocate the appropriate amount of staff payroll to the reserved Pre-ETS money. OBM staff also use this information when completing the RSA-17. 303 30 G. Expenditure Tracking for Pre-ETS a. Once an allotment for the 110-grant award is received, OBM sets aside 15% of the allotment for Pre- Employment Transition Services. The 15% is marked on the RECAP page in the ledger for Accounting Unit 2538. Specific class expenditures are tracked in the ledgers using an activity code. The ledgers are reviewed monthly to evaluate the remaining balance of the 15% of designated Pre-ETS monies. When payments are released in the case management system, the fund allocation batch process assigns the payment with the activity of 56202_90F20PET if the service is flagged as a service specific to students with disabilities, the begin date of service is within the grant’s period of performance, the participant is between the ages 14-21, and they are currently or were in an educational setting during the dates of service. The activity signifies which grant is being spent and flags the expenditure as Pre-ETS. OBM uses the activity to post and reconcile the ledgers monthly to report the Pre-ETS expenditures. 304 304 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 311 Revision # Original Implementation Date 9/1/2022 Page # 1 1 of 1 Last Reviewed/Update Date None VR Services to Groups of Individuals III.

I. Introduction The bureau's procedure on prior approval is intended to assure that all purchases made consider prior approval requirements prior to the purchase of any good or service and the correct procedure is followed when prior approval is necessary. II. Procedure A. Prior to completing program purchases, staff are required to review the list of items requiring prior approval, as described in this policy and procedure, to determine if prior approval is required before proceeding with the purchase. If the type of item requires an individualized approach and prior approval has not already been requested or approved and the purchase has not already taken place, staff will work with the Central Office Program Specialist responsible for prior approval, who will work with the Director to complete and track the prior approval request. B. Below are examples of common items frequently purchased by the bureau, whether prior approval is required, and what type of prior approval request needs to be completed if applicable. Type of item Prior Approval Needed Equipment for a participant under an IPE at any cost, including Home and Vehicle Modifications No Equipment for staff with a per item cost more than $5,000 Yes, Streamlined Process BEP initial equipment, maintenance, and replacement with a per item cost more than $5,000 Yes, Streamlined Process Participant Support Costs: Does not exceed a total cost of $5,000 per participant per training or event Certain costs that exceeds a total cost of $5,000 No Yes, Streamlined Process SRC, SILC, Independent committee costs No Equipment for the establishment, development, improvement of a facility for a public or nonprofit CRP, as identified in the comprehensive statewide assessment Yes, Individualized Process Equipment for the construction of a facility for a public or nonprofit CRP, as identified in the comprehensive statewide assessment Yes, Individualized Process 311 31 Equipment for the construction or renovation/alteration of a State facility or American Job Center for purposes allocable to VR, as identified in the comprehensive statewide assessment Yes, Individualized Process Renovation or alteration of facilities due to the acquisition of a BEP vending facility or the installation of BEP equipment Yes, Individualized Process C. Streamlined Prior Approval Process: OSERS has established a streamlined prior approval process that agencies administering the VR, Supported Employment, OIB, PAIR, and CAP programs can use for general purpose equipment that has a per unit cost of $5,000 or more. The streamlined process allows agencies to request prior approval on an aggregate basis using reasonable budget estimates for an entire federal fiscal year (FFY) as opposed to an individual basis. The estimates used are based on reliable cost estimates such as recent or past purchases, current quotes, cost research, etc. 1. In June, central office financial staff will collaborate with the Director, Business Enterprise Program (BEP), and the Older Blind (OB) program to determine and/or project all upcoming expenditures that may require prior approval. Separate Streamlined Prior Approval requests are needed based upon the Award if needed. 2. Using the designated prior approval spreadsheet, financial staff will indicate what items are to be purchased over the next FFY. The designated spreadsheet includes: a. Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) b. Period of Performance including carryover (if applicable) c. Program d. State and Agency Type e. Award Number and Grantee Name f. Agency contact information g. Submission date A, B, C, and D listed below have their own tab in the spreadsheet. Each tab contains the FFY, State and Agency Type, Award Number, Grantee Name, and the Equipment Capitalization Threshold (if applicable), which is $5,000 for New Hampshire. The items for which streamlined Prior Approval is requested: a. Equipment to be purchased for the Agency (over $5,000) 1. Estimated number of items 2. Estimated cost per item and total estimated cost 3. Any additional details b. Equipment to be purchased for BEP (over $5,000) 1. Estimated number of items 2. Estimated cost per item and total estimated cost 3. Any additional details c. Participant Support Costs (over $5,000) 1. Program requesting approval 2. Conference or Training Program 3. Estimated number of people attending 4. Total estimated cost d. Direct Salaries for Administrative and Clerical Staff 1. Position title 2. Percentage of time worked on the Program 312 31 3. Number of positions for that position title. If there are other positions with the same position title but the percentage of time worked is different from the others, the position is listed on a separate line. 4. Total estimated salary costs for the positions (do not include benefits) 5. Average cost per position 6. Brief position description (include position number(s)) 3. Once complete, financial staff will submit the spreadsheet to the Director for final review and approval. 4. Once approved by the Director, the Central Office Program Specialist responsible for prior approval will submit the request to the RSA Fiscal Management Specialist assigned to the bureau. 5. The bureau will request prior approval through the streamlined process by August 1st of each year for the subsequent FFY. D. Individualized Prior Approval Process: This process is used when the agency needs to request prior approval for something on an individual basis. 1. Using the individual prior approval form, the bureau will submit the following information to RSA: a. Date of the Request and the Program b. Specific grant to be used c. Description of the purchase d. Reason for the purchase e. Cost of the purchase f. Type of purchase: • Sole Source • Three Quotes • RFP Process g. Projected dates of service • Projected purchase date • Time frame for which the purchase is valid h. Applicable 2 CFR 200 Regulation 2. Once all information is complete, the Director will sign and date the request. 3. The Central Office Program Specialist responsible for prior approval will submit the request to the RSA Fiscal Management Specialist assigned to the bureau. 4. After approval or denial is received from RSA, the Central Office Program Specialist will let the original requestor know of the determination. E. An internal spreadsheet is used to track all individual prior approval requests. The spreadsheet keeps track of the program, item to be purchased, the cost of the item, the vendor from which the item will be purchased, the date the prior approval request was submitted to RSA, and the date the request was approved or denied by RSA. This helps financial staff in determining what prior approval requests have already been submitted. F. All electronic copies of prior approval requests are saved in a prior approval folder and all physical copies are filed. 313 31 Policy Type Service Delivery Policy Number 102 Revision # Original Implementation Date 9/1/2022 Page # 1 of 6 Last Reviewed/Update Date Original Policy Title: Signature Authority I.

DESCRIPTION: Effective staff development is a continuously active collaboration between bureau supervisors and staff. Supervisors are responsible for guiding and supporting the professional development of their staff by offering learning opportunities, creating professional development protocols, and providing coaching and feedback. To assist supervisors in providing such opportunities for staff, the bureau offers training and resources that can help staff enhance their work-related skills. Bureau staff also share in the responsibility for their own development and should talk with their supervisor about taking advantage of available resources for personal and professional growth. This policy supplements and aligns with the New Hampshire Education Department Employee Policy and Procedure Handbook Section 109 Education Policy II. DEFINITIONS: Staff development: Includes the policies, practices, procedures, and training used to develop the knowledge, skills, and competencies of staff to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of both the individual and the bureau. III. POLICY: The bureau recognizes the importance of ensuring that staff has the necessary skills and abilities to provide quality services in a professional and timely manner. All staff are expected to seek out appropriate training opportunities to enhance their performance in their current job duties. A. Staff development embraces all forms of development activity including personal study, e-learning, internal or external courses, workshops, work shadowing, and planned experiences. The aim is to support individuals through a variety of means within the available budget and identified business need. B. All staff are supported and encouraged to acquire and develop the relevant knowledge, skills, and competencies to enhance their performance in their current role and, where they are involved in succession planning, for their next role within the bureau. C. Development activities must have direct relevance to the individual’s role or objectives of the bureau. D. The bureau shall provide and encourage opportunities for staff to participate in training to gain knowledge, skills and awareness for professional growth and development. 323 32 E. Staff are eligible to participate in professional development opportunities such as workshops and seminars with supervisory/bureau approval to ensure coordination of staffing and cost implications. Approved professional development activities are generally considered as hours worked. F. The bureau is committed to providing quality vocational rehabilitation services to its customers and has developed a Comprehensive System of Personnel Development as a systemic approach to implement its staff development. This system is intended to ensure that there is an adequate number of qualified rehabilitation personnel, direct service, supervisory, administrative, fiscal, and support personnel. G. The bureau has elected to base its minimum personnel standards for vocational rehabilitation counselors on the requirement of a master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling. The bureau will continue to aspire to this level of formal training. However, if the situation presents that, there are not sufficient numbers of appropriate candidates with Masters’ degrees in Rehabilitation Counseling to fill the necessary vacant positions; the bureau will draw from a pool of candidates with a master’s or bachelor's degree in a closely related field. If an individual is hired at this lower level, the rehabilitation counselor must participate in a professional growth Plan to attain the standard to be considered a Qualified Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor. H. Staff Development Program will include, at the minimum: 1. An orientation program for new staff; 2. Training needs will be determined through an in-house needs assessment of all staff, customer satisfaction surveys, recommendations from advocacy and/or advisory groups (State Rehabilitation Council), program evaluation results, supervisory recommendations, and identified areas of need; 3. An operational plan for the provision of opportunities for all staff (professional and paraprofessional) to ensure maximum competency in implementing the provisions of all relevant federal legislation; 4. The bureau will offer succession planning, leadership training and capacity building opportunities to staff; and 5. All staff participating in training will complete evaluation forms to provide critical comments regarding the effectiveness of training and be given the opportunity to offer suggestions for future trainings. I. Requests for Bureau Payment for Training will be based on the following criteria: 1. Recommendation by the agency to meet or retrain for a particular need, 2. Relevancy of the course to the requirements of the job, 3. Availability of appropriate funding. 324 32 Procedure title: Staff Development and Training Revision date: July 1, 2023 This procedure should be followed when employees want to attend external training sessions or conferences: 1.

DESCRIPTION: The Access Control Policy aims to establish and put into place security requirements that ensure appropriate access to systems and information under the control of VRNH. This policy supplements the Access Control portion in the New Hampshire Department of Information Technology's (DoIT) Statewide Information Security Manual. II. DEFINITIONS: Confidential Information: Sensitive information that is used or held by the Agency. Considerable loss or harm could occur because of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of this information. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): An identity verification method that enhances security requires users to provide at least two pieces of evidence to prove their identity when signing into accounts. MFA provides a layered approach to securing data and applications. A system requires a user to present a combination of two or more credentials to verify a user's identity for login. MFA increases security because even if one credential becomes compromised, unauthorized users cannot meet the second authentication requirement and cannot access the targeted physical space, computing device, network, or database. Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Restricted Information: Highly sensitive information used or held by an agency. Statutory or regulatory penalties, notification provisions, or other mandates could result if the information is accessed, used, or disclosed in an unauthorized manner. Sensitive Information: Information critical to ongoing operations that should not be copied, shared, or removed outside of the organization without authority. III. POLICY: The Bureau shall establish specific requirements for protecting information and information systems against unauthorized access. These requirements will guide the administration, control, and access tracking of systems and assets within VRNH. A. General Access 1. Any user requiring access to VRNH systems or data must submit a formal written request for access to the specific data or system. This will be tracked using the Department of Education's preferred method. 335 33 2. The system owner or data owner must approve access to the specific systems or data assets. Access requests must demonstrate a business need for that access. B. Remote Access Requirements: 1. Remote access shall be controlled with encryption (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)), whenever feasible. 2. Authorized users shall protect their login and password at all times. 3. When connecting to the internal network from a third-party network not completely controlled by the authorized user (i.e., public networks such as a coffee shop or airport Wi- Fi), staff must use a VPN for access. 4. Prior approval from DoIT must be acquired before using personal equipment to remotely connect to the VRNH internal network or any other VRNH-managed systems. C. Third-Party Access Requirements 1. Third-party users (Contractors) must complete the equivalent or higher-level Security Awareness Training provided by NH DoIT to all State employees. Once this training has been completed, proof of completion shall be provided to VRNH prior to access. 2. Any Contractor requesting access to systems or data assets residing in or on the VRNH environment must have completed background checks. D. Account Management Requirements 1. Users accessing systems or data within the VRNH environment shall use MFA, whenever feasible. 2. Users must use their own unique login, which is not shared with or disclosed to any other user. 3.

Users will have a role assigned based on their job requirements and duties. 5. Data or system owners will follow the departmental procedures for removing permissions from users who no longer require access to the data or systems. 6. User accounts within VRNH's purview will be subject to routine audits in alignment with the department's policies and procedures. E. System Administration Requirements 1. VRNH systems will be configured to require: a. User authentication, in addition to MFA, are required whenever feasible and appropriate. b. System logs will be enabled to track user access. c. System Administrators, when feasible, will monitor for inactive accounts. d. Role-based access controls will be put into place. i. Role-based access will ensure that data access is limited to comply with the least- privilege principle which holds that every user, program, or system component should have the minimum level of access or privileges necessary to perform their required tasks. 336 33 e. User accounts will be limited to a specific number of consecutive invalid login attempts within a defined time period. (e.g., Three (3) consecutive invalid login attempts within five (5) minutes.) After that, the user's account will be locked until an administrator unlocks it. f. If a user is logged in but has been idle for a specified time, the system will be locked. It will require the user to re-enter their password before they can use the system again. F. Physical Access Requirements 1. Usernames and passwords must not be written on physical surfaces. (i.e. post-its notes, whiteboards, etc.) 2. Physical access to systems and/or data within the VRNH environment will be documented. a. This access can be granted and tracked via access cards, keys, or any other method the VRNH department deems appropriate. b. Access requests must also be provided in writing using tickets, emails, or whichever system VRNH requires. c. Lost or stolen access cards/keys must be reported immediately. G.
